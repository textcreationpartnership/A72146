            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſacrifice of my Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Dedication of theſe Labours (<hi>excellent</hi> PRINCE) had gone a more humble way of Ambition, than through the hands of Kings and Princes, could I afterwards have juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ſuch humiliations. But the Tenure of this work is a Title-Royall, which no laps of time nor alteration of language can reverſe. In the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall entitled to a King; ſo continued in the Tranſlation, and ſo in a direct line deſcends upon <hi>Your Highneſſe,</hi> as a part of a Royall Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which I durſt not alienate by a lower inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Author is Sir <hi>Francis Bacon,</hi> a name well known in the European world; a learned man, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the learned'ſt, that ever lived, ſince the decay
<pb facs="tcp:150781:6"/> of the Grecian and Romane Empires; when learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was at a high pitch; and Which riſe and fell with thoſe Monarchies; for Scepters and Sciences have the ſame revolutions, the ſame periods. In the vaſt ſpaces of time between thoſe and theſe laſt Ages, Philoſophy hath bin, as it were in a ſlumber, for many centuries of years. For after the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith grew up, the moſt writers betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Theology, and ſome miſtaking the right limits of Faith and Reaſon, fell fowle upon Ariſtotle and other Philoſophers, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches of Ereſy, which were the Patrons of Reaſon. Somewhat awaked from this ſlumber ſhe was, by the Arabian writers, the Schoole-Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors and Spaniſh Interpreters; made more active by the Chimique Philoſophers, but never perfectly recovered untill the daies of this Author, who is the firſt that ever joynd Rationall &amp; Experimentall Philoſophy in a regular correſpondence; which before was either a ſubtlety of words, or a confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of matter. He after he had ſurvaied all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Antiquity, after the volumnes of men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelfe to the ſtudy of the volumne of the world; and having conquerd what ever books poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt (his ſpacious ſpirit not thus bounded) ſet upon the Kingdome of Nature, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:150781:6"/> that victory very farre; and which was more than thoſe victories, himſelfe being mortall, left ſuch lawes behind him, as may ſuffice to ſubdue the reſt, if Princes encourage men, and men be not wanting to themſelves. This attempt of his was favour'd by the ſtarres of his Nativity. For it was his felicity to live in the times of two <hi>Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of Learning,</hi> K. IAMES <hi>Your Highneſſe</hi> Grandfather of bleſſed memory, and Your Royall Father now Raigning; and it was their glory that he lived in their times; and will be the eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this Nation, that the <hi>Greateſt Kings</hi> and the <hi>Greateſt Philoſopher</hi> met togither in one age, in one Iland. By the favour of <hi>his Prince,</hi> who well knew the valew of Learning and Learned men, he was raiſed to the higheſt dignities in the Civile ſtate; and by his own happie Genius, to the higheſt degree in the ſtate of learning; which was the greater wonder of the two; being ſuch incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible perfections, and divided, enough to fill up the ſphere of the greateſt abilities alive. Yet with great applauſe he acted both theſe high parts, of the greateſt Scholler and the greateſt States-man of his time: and ſo quit himſelfe in both, as one and the ſame Perſon, in title and merit, became Lord Keeper of the Great ſeale of England, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:150781:7"/> Great Seale of Nature both at once, which is a myſtery beyond the comprehenſion of his own times, and a miracle requires a great meaſure of faith in Poſterity, to believe it. This is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor I here preſent unto <hi>Your Highneſſe,</hi> this his worke, which by the powerfull influence of Your favour ſhall proſper, and, it may be, be quickned to the regeneration of another Phoenix out of his aſhes, to adorne your World: for it is only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne aſpect &amp; irradiation of <hi>Princes,</hi> that inſpires the Globe of learning, and makes Arts, and ſciences grow up and floriſh. Heaven bleſſe <hi>Your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> with bleſsings on the right hand and on the left, and make You Heire of all the virtues of your Royall Progenitors, that the Honour of Princes begun in them, may be continued in Your perſon; and that a future age may be ſo bleſſed in You, as the preſent is in Your Royall Father, <hi>the Glory of Kings and their Admiration.</hi>

The waies and ends of theſe two knowledges (I meane of what we have, and of what we may have) thus different; and the principles upon which they proceed ſo divers; both may conſiſt without contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and confutations; or the invaſions upon their diſtinguiſht rights: &amp; ſo the <hi>propagation of Knowledge,</hi> by the aſsiſtance, <hi>of the Father of Lights,</hi> may be purſued, with the reſervation of the honour of Ancient and Moderne Authors, and the Arts in uſe, which reſpecting the end whereto they were inſtituted, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputation, Redargution</hi> and the like, are very conducent, and in their way of perfection highly exalted. And this is the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of deliberating the publication of my Apologetique, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the buſineſſe. <hi>Another is this.</hi> The times into which we are fallen, are learned Times, as ever were ſince the Grecian Philoſophers, and, their ſeconds, the Arabian writers, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through the great advantages, of the experiments of later A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and the directions of Antiquity, in many particulars have out-gon their predeceſſors; ſo as he that dare adventure, as, ſome doe, to intrude unſtudied thoughts upon ſo learned an age as this is, neither reverences the age as he ought, nor wiſely conſults his own reputation with Poſterity. And as the Times are learned, ſo (which too frequently falls out) ſomewhat confident. Great wits, and which have fortified their conceptions by books and ſtudy, are ſtrongly prepoſſeſt with almost impregnable anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and not ſo eaſily induced, as more inconcerned and diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged natures are; to know or unknow any thing, that either ſhould be farther inquired into, or ſhould be for gotten. And much within theſe two orbs our Apology moves; in diſcovery of
<pb facs="tcp:150781:8"/> Jgnorance &amp; of Error; of what we know not, and of what we ſhould not know. For certainly much knowledge remaines yet conceal'd, and the way to this diſcovery is by forgoeing many unprofitable ſubtleties; and by a learn'd ignorance falling off from many aery ſpeculations, to the ſolid ſimplicity of the Ancients. Were we to compoſe a Panegyrique in praiſe of the perfections of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our daies, which indeed merits ſuch a ſacrifice, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour were but halfe what it is, for laudatory hymnes ſeldome come out of ſeaſon; they need no preparations, and what might be wanting in the waight of ſpeech, would be ſupplied by an aptitude to accept and believe. But in the buſineſſe in hand, the <hi>mind of man,</hi> the principall ſubject to be wrought upon, and <hi>her ſpeculations,</hi> both which we ſo admire, are ſo immur'd and blockt up with corrupt notions, either from the placits of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, the depraved lawes of Demonſtration; or from inherent qualities in the generall nature of man, or individuate tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of particulars; that nothing can be done untill theſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; at leaſt, ſubjected to examination: which is another mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive that ſtaies me upon the Land. <hi>An other Reaſon,</hi> (which is the laſt I will trouble the Reader withall is this. Time the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of all our Actions, without whoſe aſsiſtance our beſt concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are <hi>Abortives,</hi> by the intercurrence of other engagements (which I might have diſpenced withall, had I rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſervile tenure of ſecular contracts) hath ſurpriz'd me. I conceive, which I pronounce with ſome paſsion, that a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler for his ſtudies, had bin the maſter of his own howres; but he-that trafiques with the world ſhall finde it otherwiſe. Time which I preſum'd I could command, and ſtay as I doe my watch, hath commanded me. And theſe diverſions were ſeconded <hi>(Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reader)</hi> by a ſad Accident. It pleaſed God in the heat of my attendance on this buſineſſe, to take away, by one of the terrors of mortality, the <hi>Stone,</hi> my deare brother <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> RICHARD SCOT,</hi> ſervant to the moſt Eminent <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Lo. Deputy Generall of Ireland;</hi> beloved of his deare <hi>Lord</hi> to the lateſt minute of life; honour'd with his preſence to the farthest confines of mortality; and there, by his Noble Piety, deliver'd up, with as much ſolemnity, as a Kingdome could conferre, unto the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
<pb facs="tcp:150781:9"/> of another world. This deadly ſhaft paſsing through him, ſo wounded me, that I my ſelfe was arrived within few paces of the land of darkneſſe. Jn his <hi>ſilent</hi> Marble, the beſt part of that ſmall portion of joy I had in the World; but <hi>all my hopes,</hi> are entombed. This penſive caſualty ſo took me off from books and buſineſſe, as for ſome months after, I could reliſh no thoughts but what were mingled with the contemplations of mortality. <hi>Sic fugit interea fugit irrevocabile tempus.</hi> Theſe were the impediments to my <hi>Apologetique;</hi> which (if what is done be accepted) ſhall be prefix'd the <hi>NOV. ORG.</hi> For of this Tranſlation this is the first part <hi>(Reader)</hi> if it pleaſe thee, if it pleaſe thee not, the laſt. But before I take my leave, here are ſome tacite objections, which I would meet halfe way, and ſo weaken their approaches, leſt they fall too heavy upon me. <hi>The firſt is,</hi> touching the <hi>Diviſion of the firſt book into Chapters,</hi> contrary to the mind of the Author, and the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the work. This exception may be thus ſatisfied, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is to be preferred before artificiall contrivance, where both cannot ſo conveniently be had, and to this end, diſcretion to be followed before rule. Were the Author now alive and his vaſt Deſignes going on, this alteration had been ſomewhat bold: but the inimitable Architect now dead, having perfected litle more then the outward Courts, as it were, of his magnificent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration; and the whole ſumme of Sciences, and the ſtock of Arts in preſent poſſeſsion, not able to defray the charges of fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this Fabrique; I thought fit, by compartitions and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions into ſeverall roomes, to improve what we have, to our beſt advantage, ſo it might be done without prejudice to the Authors procedure, and apt coherence, which J hope it is: Having reſpect herein rather to accommodation than decoration; for <hi>Houſes</hi> (as our Author ſaies) <hi>are built to live in and not to look on, and therefore uſe to be preferred before uniformity.</hi> Another Exception may be made againſt the draught of the Platforme into <hi>Analytique tables,</hi> which ſeems ſomewhat pedantique and against that common rule <hi>Artis eſt diſsimulare Artem.</hi> To this J anſwer thus. <hi>Order</hi> and dependance is as it were, the ſoule of the World, of the Works of Nature and Art, and that which
<pb facs="tcp:150781:9"/> keeps them united, without which all would fall aſunder and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the firſt Chaos before the production of light. And of all <hi>Methods</hi> that ever were, at least that ever came to our hands, our Authors is the moſt naturall and moſt dependent. For <hi>Truth,</hi> as it reflects on us, is a congruent conformity of the Jntellect to the Object; and of the different faculties thereof, to the difference of things: wherefore the truest <hi>Partition</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning, is that, which hath reference to humane facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when the <hi>Intellectuall Globe,</hi> and the <hi>Globe of the World,</hi> intermixe their beams and irradiations in a direct line of projection, to the Generation of Sciences. This our Author hath perform'd to admiration; and in this gone beyond all Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, yet upon their grounds; wherein he can never be out-gone, unleſſe followed, by Poſterity. The Ancients indeed, were men of moſt profound ſpeculations, but in the delivery of themſelves, ſomewhat involv'd, as appears by <hi>Plotinus, Proclus, Triſme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtus</hi> and others; and many of <hi>Platoes</hi> Schoole writ Dialogue-wiſe, which is no doctrinal way. As for <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> his precepts touching <hi>method</hi> (if any ſuch book was written) they are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht; ſaving where he ſcatters ſuch rules here and there, which ſhould have been ſilenced, and are not ſo well followed by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And for the <hi>Methods</hi> of the Modernes, <hi>Ramus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the improvement of <hi>German</hi> writers, impair'd; they knit the limmes of knowledge to ſoone; have bedwarfed Sciences, <hi>and are become an Art</hi> (as learned <hi>Hooker</hi> expreſſes it) <hi>which teaches the way of ſpeedy diſcourſe, and reſtrains the mind of man, that it may not waxe over-wiſe.</hi> The <hi>Excellency</hi> therefore of our Authors <hi>Partitions,</hi> induced me to theſe <hi>delineations,</hi> for their uſe only, who have not the leaſure, or patience to obſerve it according to the merit; that by this <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,</hi> the junctures and arteries, as it were, of this great body might more viſibly appeare. <hi>An other objection is,</hi> touching the <hi>Allegations in the Margin,</hi> contrary to the ſolemne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of Antiquity, and the moſt of graver Authors. <hi>For this</hi> I had theſe reaſons. It pleaſed our Author, thoe he was himſelfe a living fountain of knowledge, and had a wealthy ſtock of his own, yet to taſt of other waters, and to borrow from Antiquity, and to
<pb facs="tcp:150781:10"/> acknowledge ſuch borrowings, He thus nameing his Authors, I thought fit to note them. And as he was a man of a moſt elevated phanſie and choice conceptions; ſo was he in the ſelection of his Authors, and the paſſages he pleas'd to make uſe of: and it is worth the labour to know with whom ſuch great wits uſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; to point to the <hi>Mines</hi> where they digge their Ore; and to the ſhadowes where they repoſe at noone. And as his ſelection of Authors was very choice, ſo was his application of their ſayings, very curious; and in a ſtrain beyond the vulgar reach. Places out of <hi>Sacred Scriptures</hi> are ſo explicated, ſo applied, as you may ſearch all the Commenters that are extant, and not finde the like expoſitions, as you ſhall finde in him. As for humane Authors he betters his borrowings from them; teaching the alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations out of them, a ſenſe above the meaning of him that lent it him; and which he repaies too with double intereſt for what he borrowed. Theſe conſiderations invited me to Marginall Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Theſe Reaſons ſet apart, I cannot approve this weake am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; and doe, not without cenſure, read Moderne Authors pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute to humane allegations; as if the <hi>Truth</hi> they deliver, were to be tried by voices; or having loſt its primitive Innocence, must be cover'd with theſe fig-leaves; or as if the Authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were afraid that it ſhould make an eſcape out of their text, if it were not beſet in the Margin with Authorities as with a watch. <hi>The laſt exception is,</hi> touching the <hi>Prefaces,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Introductions</hi> prefix'd this worke, that make the Gates and Entries ſo wide, as they ſeem to invite the Citty to run away. This is thus anſwer'd. Jt muſt be remembred that this worke in the Deſigne was very ſpacious; and is in the performance of what is done ſo ample, that when the ſecond and third Parts ſhall be added, as added they will be, the <hi>Porches</hi> and <hi>Ingreſſes,</hi> in the judgement of any good Architect, are proportionable enough. And if our <hi>Authors</hi> rule hold, that every faire Fabrique ſhould have three Courts; a greene Court; a ſecond Court more gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht; and a third to make a ſquare with the Front; then have you here this Epiſtle as the mean Court; Iudgements upon this Author living and dead, as the middle Court; and the Authors own excellent Preface to confront with the work it ſelfe. <hi>Now
<pb facs="tcp:150781:10"/> I ſhould,</hi> ſay ſomething touching <hi>Tranſlation;</hi> and as it is mine. The very Action is ſomewhat obnoxious to cenſure; being of the nature of thoſe, the failing whereof may diſgrace more, than the carrying of it through, credit the undertaker. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the conſcience of the deed done; for other ends I could not have; (the Author now dead, and alive <hi>mihi nec injuriis nec beneficiis notus</hi>) and that to be a <hi>Tranſlator</hi> is more than to be an <hi>Author,</hi> ſome ſuch as there be; and that it is no ſuch mean office, to bear a light before a <hi>Lord Chancellor of England:</hi> I ſhould excuſe it, were the example mine: ſo, writes learned <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> ſo, eloquent <hi>Sandys;</hi> ſo, <hi>Malvezzi's Noble Interpreter;</hi> with whom conferred I am leſſe than a ſhadow: So, many able and eminent names of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and other Nations; So the Ancients of former ages and of all Arguments. But if any be ſo ſolemne, ſo ſevere, and of ſuch primitive taſts, they can away with no waters, which come not from the ſpring-head; nor endure to drink of <hi>Tiber,</hi> that paſſes through <hi>Thames;</hi> They may give over here, if they ſo pleaſe, and proceed no farther. This interpretation was not meant for ſuch faſtidious palates, and yet, it may be, for as diſtinguiſhing as theirs are. Now if this very action be thus liable to exception, much more muſt my performance be. Certainly books by <hi>Tranſlation</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take wind in the effuſion; and for strength fall ſhort of their <hi>Originals;</hi> as reflexed beams are weaker than direct: but then it muſt be underſtood of <hi>Originals,</hi> truly ſo. For if a <hi>Writer</hi> deliver himſelfe out of his Native language, J ſee not why a <hi>Tranſlator</hi> rendring him in it, may not come neare him: and in this caſe, the Author himſelfe is the <hi>Interpreter,</hi> being he <hi>tranſlates</hi> his own thoughts, which originally ſpeak his mother tongue. Yet for all this, Errors I know there are, and ſome lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which require a Connivence; and a Reader hath this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that he may ſtay upon one period, as long as an Jnterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did on one page; beſides his peculiar Genius to ſome ſtudied paſſages. Some Errors (paſsing but a tranſient eye upon what is done) J ſee already; and could note them; but I would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly gratify ſome kind of Readers ſo farre. They that are Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and ingenious too (for J would have no Readers that
<pb facs="tcp:150781:11"/> have not theſe two ingredients in their compoſitions, thoe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I name but one, which I would then, ſhould be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) will in their judgements find them, and in their mercy pardon them. <hi>As for Sophiſts</hi> and <hi>Satyriſts,</hi> a degenerate Race of men, that ſit upon the lives and learning of all that write; who reſolv'd to doe nothing themſelves, may with more ſecurity cenſure others: and them too, who, as <hi>Learned DON</hi> deciphers them, <hi>forbid not bookes, but men; damning what ever ſuch a name, hath, or ſhall write:</hi> they are <hi>things</hi> below the merit of my indignation; objects of Scorne; which a litle ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not inflamed by oppoſition, or countenanced to a reply by confutation, will within a while, of themſelves, extinguiſh, and vaniſh: like ſome diſperſed roving winds, which without encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre are diſpirited and die. And it concernes me, Courteous Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to put on ſuch a confidence as this; for being I am likely to appeare in mine own perſon, as I doe now in the Perſon of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to be too tender-fronted were to invite injuries, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſuch unſeaſonable modesty to abuſe. He that will to ſea, muſt look for ſome cloudy daies; and to be too <hi>ſcrupulous</hi> or <hi>Ceremonious</hi> touching <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Perſons,</hi> is the bane of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and of all well-meant endeavours: according to that of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Qui obſervat ventum non ſeminat, &amp; qui conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Nubes, nunquam metet.</hi>

               <p>For in my judgement, it is a matter which concernes not only the Benefit of others; but our own Reputation alſo; that no man imagine that we have projected in our minds ſome ſlight ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall notion of theſe <hi>Deſignes;</hi> and that they are of the nature of thoſe things, which we could <hi>Deſire,</hi> and which we accept only as <hi>good wiſhes.</hi> For they are ſuch as without queſtion, are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the power and poſsibility of men to compaſſe, unleſſe they be wanting to themſelves; and hereof, we for our parts, have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and evident demonſtration; <hi>for we come not hether, as Augures, to meaſure Countries in our mind, for Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but as Captaines, to invade them for a conqueſt.</hi>

               <p>I doe foreſee that many of thoſe things which I ſhall register as <hi>DEFICIENTS</hi> will incurre divers cenſures; as <hi>that ſome parts</hi> of this enterprize were done long agoe, and are now extant; <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that they taſt of curioſity &amp; promiſe no great fruit; <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that they are impoſsible to be compaſſed by humane indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries. <hi>For the two firſt,</hi> let the particulars ſpeak for themſelves. <hi>For the laſt touching impoſsibilities,</hi> I determine thus.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150781:22"/> of the underſtanding, or by the aides and aſsiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Logick, there was no hope at all; becauſe that the Primitive Notions of Things, which the mind with a too facile and ſupine attractive faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives in; treaſures up and accumulates, from which all the reſt are derived; are unſound, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and raſhly abſtracted from things. The like luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant vanity and inconſtancy there is in the ſecond and ſequent Notions; whence it comes to paſſe, that all that human Reaſon which we employ, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Inquiſition of Things, is not well digeſted and built; but like ſome magnificent Pile without foundation. For whileſt men admire and celebrate the counterfeit forces of the mind; hir true powers which might be raiſed (were right directions admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, and ſhe taught to become obſequious to things, and not impotently to inſult over them) they paſse by and looſe.

And this though it may ſeeme in a ſort an infinit enterprize, and above mortall abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, yet the ſame will be found more ſound and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, than thoſe performances which hetherto have bin atchieved: for in this there is ſome iſsue; but in the endeavours now undertaken about Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a perpetuall wheeling, Agitation and Circle. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is he ignorant how unfrequented this <hi>Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:150781:22"/> is, how difficile and incredible to perſwade a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, yet he thought not to deſert the deſigne, nor himſelfe, but to try and ſet upon the way, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is pervious and penetrable to the mind of Man. For it is better to give a beginning to a thing which may once come to an end, than with an eternall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention &amp; ſtudie to be enwrapt in thoſe mazes which are endleſſe. And the waies of Contemplation for moſt part reſemble thoſe celebrated waies of Action; the one, at the firſt entrance hard and difficult, ends in an open plain; the other at firſt fight ready and eaſy, leads into by-waies and downfalls: And being he was uncertain when ſuch conſiderations ſhould hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter come into any mans mind, induced eſpecially from this argument, that there hath none hetherto appear'd, who hath applied his mind to ſuch cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he reſolv'd to publiſh, ſeperatly, the <hi>Firſt parts</hi> as they could be perfected. Neither is this an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous but ſollicitous feſtination; that if in the mean ſpace he ſhould depart this mortall ſtation; there might yet remain a deſignation and deſtination of the thing he comprehended in his mind; and withall ſome Demonſtration of his ſincere and propenſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to promote the good of Mankind. Truly he eſtimed other ambition whatſoever, inferior to the buſineſſe he had in hand: For either the matter in conſultation, and thus farre proſequuted, is nothing; or ſo much as the conſcience of the merit it ſelfe, ought to give him contentment without ſeeking a recompence from abroad.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T ſeemes to me, that men neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Eſtate they poſſeſſe, nor their Abilities to purchaſe; but of the one to preſume more; of the other, leſſe, than indeed they ſhould. So it comes to paſſe, that over-prizing the Arts received, they make no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inquiry; or undervaluing themſelues, more than in equity they ought, they expend their Abilities upon matters of ſlight conſequence, never once making expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of thoſe things which conduce to the ſumme of the buſineſſe. Wherefore, <hi>Sciences alſo have,</hi> as it were, <hi>their Fatall Columnes;</hi> being men are not exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150781:24"/> either out of Deſire, or Hope, to penetrate farther. And ſeeing <hi>the Opinion of Wealth is one of the chief cauſes of want;</hi> and that out of a confidence of what we poſſeſſe in preſent, true aſsiſtances are deſpiſed for the future, it is expedient, nay altogether neceſſary, that the exceſsive Reverence and Admiration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of thoſe <hi>Sciences,</hi> which hetherto have bin found out, ſhould in the Front and Entrance of this work, (and that roundly and undiſſemblingly) by ſome wholſome premonition, be taken off, leſt their Copie and Vtility be too much Magnified and Celebrated. For he that ſurvaies with diligence all the variety of Books, wherein <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> triumph, ſhall every where finde infinite repetitions of the ſame matter; for manner of Delivery diverſe, but for Invention ſtale and preoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupate; ſo as what at firſt view ſeem'd numerous, after examination taken, are found much abated. § As for Profit J may confidently avouch it, that the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome we have extracted, chiefly from the Grecians, ſeems to be a Child-hood of Knowledge, and to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate that which is proper to children, namely, <hi>that it is apt for talk; but impotent and immature for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi> for it is of Controverſies rank and fertile, but of works barren and fruitleſſe. So that the Fable and fiction of <hi>Scylla,</hi> ſeemes to be a lively Image of the <hi>ſtate of Learning,</hi> as now it is, which for the upper parts had the face and countenance of a comely Virgin; but was from the wombe downward circled, and enwrapt with <hi>barking Monſters,</hi> So the <hi>Sciences</hi> wherein we are trained up, contain in them certain Generalities
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150781:24"/> ſpecious and plauſible, but when you deſcend unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, as to the Parts of Generation, expecting ſolid effects, and ſubſtantiall operations, then Contentions and Barking Altercations ariſe, wherein they cloſe, and which ſupply the place of a fruitfull wombe. § Again, if theſe kinds of Sciences were not altogether a meere liveleſse Thing, me thinkes it ſhould not have falne out, which now for many Ages hath continued, that <hi>they</hi> ſhould thus ſtand at a ſtay, in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable in their firſt Footings, without any <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> worthy the Race of Mankind, in ſuch a dull Jmproficience, that not only Aſſertion remaines Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but Queſtion reſts ſtill Queſtion, which by Diſputes is not determined, but fixt and cheriſht: and all Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Succeſsion of Diſcipline delivered from hand to hand, preſents and exhibits the Perſons of Teacher and Schollar, not of Inventor or of one ſhould adde ſomething of note to what is invented. § But in Arts Mechanicall we ſee the contrary hath come to paſſe, which as if they were inſpired by the vitall breath and prolifique influence of a thriving Aire, are daily <hi>Propagated</hi> and <hi>Perfected;</hi> and which in their firſt Autors appeared, for the moſt part rude and even bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome and Formeleſſe, have afterward acquir'd new-refind virtues and a certain apt Propriety and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Accommodation, ſo infinitely fruitfull, that ſooner may mens ſtudies and deſires languiſh, and change, than theſe <hi>Sciences</hi> arive at their full height and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. § Contrariwiſe <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Intellectuall,</hi> like <hi>Statues</hi> are ador'd and celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150781:25"/> but nothing <hi>Advanc't;</hi> nay commonly of moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor in their firſt Autor, and by Time Degenerate and become embaſed. For ſince the time men became <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted</hi> and, as <hi>Pedary Senators,</hi> reſigned over to the Placits and Definitions of one, they doe not adde any <hi>Amplitude to Sciences,</hi> but are wholly taken up in a ſervile duty of <hi>Poliſhing</hi> or <hi>Protecting</hi> certain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. § And let no man here alleage, that <hi>Sciences</hi> growing up by degrees, have at length arrived to a juſt period or perfect Stature, and ſo (as having filled up the juſt ſpaces of <hi>Augmentation</hi>) have ſetled and fixt themſelves in the workes of ſome few Autors; and now that nothing more accompliſht can be found out, there remaines no more to doe, but that the <hi>Sciences</hi> already extant be improved, and adorned. Jndeed it could be wiſht that the <hi>ſtate of Learning were thus proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;</hi> but the very truth is, theſe mancipations and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile reſignations of <hi>Sciences,</hi> is nothing elſe but a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant humor, bred out of a dareing lust and confidence in ſome few, and a languiſhing ſloth and Puſillanimity in the reſt. For when <hi>Sciences</hi> (for ſome parts it may be) have bin tilled and laboured with diligence, then perchance hath there riſen up ſome bold-undertaking wit, for Compendious brevity of Method populare, and plauſible, who in ſhew hath conſtituted a <hi>Science,</hi> but indeed depraved the <hi>Labours of the Ancients:</hi> Yet theſe Abridgements finde acceptation with Poſterity, for the expedite uſe of ſuch a work, and to avoid the trouble and impatience of a new <hi>Inquiry.</hi> § And if any ſtand upon <hi>Conſent now inveterate,</hi> as the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150781:25"/> and teſt of Time, let him know he builds upon a very deceivable and infirme Foundation. Nor is it, for moſt part, ſo revealed unto us, what in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> hath bin diſcovered and brought to light in diverſe ages, and different Regions of the world; much leſſe wbat hath bin experimented, and ſeriouſly laboured by particular Perſons in priuate; <hi>For neither the Birthes, nor the Abortions of Time have bin Regiſtred.</hi> § Nor is Conſent it ſelf, nor the long continuation thereof, with ſuch reverence be adored, for however there may be many kindes of <hi>States</hi> in <hi>Civile Government; yet the State of Sciences is but one,</hi> which alwaies was, and ſo will continue, <hi>Populare;</hi> and with the People the Diſciplines moſt in requeſt are either <hi>Pugnacious</hi> and <hi>Polemicall;</hi> or <hi>Specious</hi> and <hi>Frivolous;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as either <hi>illaqueate</hi> or <hi>allure</hi> the <hi>Aſſent.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore without queſtion, the greateſt wits in every age have bin over-borne, &amp; in a ſort tyrannized over, whilſt men of Capacity and Comprehenſion about the vulgare, yet conſulting their own Credit and Reputation, have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves to the over-ſwaying Judgement of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Multitude.</hi> Therefore if in any <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Place,</hi> more profound Contemplations have perchance emerged and revealed themſelves, they have bin forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with toſt and extinguiſht by the Windes and Tempeſts of <hi>Populare opinions:</hi> ſo that <hi>Time like a River car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries down to us that which is light and blowen up; but ſinks and drownes that which is waighty and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</hi> § Nay the very ſame Autors, who bave uſurpt a kind of <hi>Dictature in Sciences,</hi> and with ſuch confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150781:29"/> And withall, we muſt continually make our way, through the woods of Experiences, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Natures, by the incertain Light of Senſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhining ſometimes ſhadowed: yea and the guides, which (as hath bin toucht) offer their aſsiſtance, they likewiſe are entangled, and help to make up the number of Errors and of thoſe that Erre. In matters of ſuch perplext difficulty, there is no relying upon <hi>the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men</hi> from their own abilities; or upon the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall Felicity of Particular events;</hi> for neither the <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Man,</hi> how excellent ſoever; nor the <hi>chance of Experience,</hi> never ſo often iterated and eſſayed, is of force to conquer theſe myſteries: we muſt march by line and levell, and all the way, even from the firſt percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Senſes, muſt be ſecured, and fortified by a certain Rule, and conſtant Method of proceeding. § Yet are not theſe things ſo to be underſtood, as if, in ſo many Ages, and ſo much Induſtry, nothing at all hath bin performed to purpoſe; nor is there any cauſe why it ſhould repent us of the <hi>Diſcoveries</hi> already made; for certainly the Ancients, in thoſe ſpeculations which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſtrength of wit, and abſtract meditation, have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved themſelves men of admirable comprehenſions: But as in the <hi>Art of Navigation,</hi> the men of former Ages, directing their courſe by obſeruation of ſtarres only, could edge along the coaſt of the known Continent, and it may be, croſſe ſome narrow Seas or the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean; but before the Ocean could be thus commanded, and the Regions of the new world diſcovered, it was requiſite that the uſe of the <hi>Mariners needle,</hi> as a more
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150781:29"/> ſure and certain guide ſhould be firſt found out; even ſo what diſcoveries ſoever have bin hetherto made in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> they are of that quality, as might have bin brought to light by Practice, Meditation, Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Diſcourſe, as things neerer the ſenſes, and for moſt part, under the command of common Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but before we can make our approaches, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and hidden ſecrets of Nature, it is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that a better and more perfect uſe, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique-operation of the Mind and underſtanding Faculty be introduc't. § As for us, ſurely we, (vanquiſht with an immortall love of Truth) have expos'd our ſelves to doubtfull, difficult, and deſert Pathes; and by the protection and aſsiſtance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, have borne up and encouraged our ſelves, againſt the violent Aſſaults and prepared Armies, as it were, of Opinions, and againſt our own private and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heſitations and ſcruples, and againſt the cloudes and darkneſſe of Nature, and euery where flying fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; that ſo we might procure the preſent and future Age more ſafe and ſound Jndications and Impreſsions of Truth. If in this high and arduous attempt, we have made any <hi>Proficience,</hi> ſurely by no other means have we cleered our ſelves a way, than by a ſincere and juſt <hi>humiliation of the ſpirit of Man, to the lawes and operations of Nature.</hi> For all they that went before us, who applied themſelves to the finding out of <hi>Arts,</hi> caſting a tranſient eye upon Things, examples, and experience, have preſently (as if Jnvention were nothing elſe but a meere Agitation of Braine) invoked
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150781:30"/> in a manner their own ſpirits, to divine and utter Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles unto them: but we being chaſtly and perpetually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with the operations of Nature, divorce not the Jntellect from the Object farther than that the Images and beams of things (as in ſenſe) may meet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrate; by which manner of proceeding, there is not much left to the ſtrength and excellency of wit. The ſame ſubmiſsion of ſpirit we have practiſed in diſcovery, we have followed in Delivery: Nor have we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſet off ourſelves with Glory, or draw a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty upon our inventions, either by Triumphs of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; or Depoſitions of Antiquity; or an uſurpation of Authority; or the vaile of Obſcurity; which are Arts he may eaſily find out, whoſe study is not ſo much the Profit of others, as Applauſe to himſelfe. I ſay we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have practiſed, nor goe we about, by force or fraud to circumvent mens Judgements, but conduct them to the things themſelves, and to the league and confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Things, that they may ſee what they have, what they reprehend, what they adde and contribute to the Publique. And if we have bin too credulous, or too dormant, and not ſo intentive upon the matter, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht in the way, or broken off the thread of the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> yet notwithſtanding we preſent things after ſuch a manner open and naked, that our Errors may be dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſeparated before they can ſpread themſelves, or inſinuate their Contagion into the maſſe of Sciences; and after ſuch a Method as the continuation of our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, is a matter facile and expedite. By this means we preſume we have eſtabliſht for ever, <hi>a true and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150781:30"/> Marriage, between the Empiricall and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall faculty;</hi> whoſe faſtidious and unfortunate Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce and Separation, hath troubled and diſordered the whole Race and Generation of Man-kind. § And ſeeing theſe performances are not within the compaſſe of our meere naturall Power and command, we doe heere, in the Acceſſe to this work, <hi>Powre forth hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt and moſt ardent ſupplications to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the Word, God the Spirit, that they being mindfulll of the Miſeries of Mankind, and of the Pilgrimage of this life, wherein we weare out few &amp; evill daies, they would vouchſafe to endow man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by my hand with new Donatives. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, we humbly pray, that Humane knowledges, may no way impeach, or prejudice Divine Truths; nor that from the diſcloſing of the waies of ſenſe, and the letting in of a more plentifull Naturall Light, any miſts of Incredulity or clouds of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ariſe in our minds, touching Divine Myſteries; but rather that from a purified Intellect, purged from Fancies and Vanity, and yet yeelded and abſolutely rendred up to Divine oracles; the tributes of Faith may be rendred to Faith. In the laſt place, that the venome of knowledge infuſed by the Serpent, whereby the mind of man is ſwelled and blown up, being voided; we may not be too aſpireingly wiſe, or above ſobriety, but that we may improve and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Verity in Charity.</hi> § Now we have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our vowes to heaven, converting our ſelves to men, we admoniſh them ſomethings that are Profitable, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150781:31"/> requeſt of them ſome things that are equall. Firſt we admoniſh (which thing we have alſo prayed for,) that we keep human Reaſon within due Limits in matters Divine, and Senſe within compaſſe: <hi>For ſenſe like the Sunne,</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150781:31"/> Soule of man to be his Play-fellow in this game. § In ſumme, I would adviſe all in generall, that they would take into ſerious conſideration the true and Genuine ends of <hi>knowledge;</hi> that they ſeek it not either for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; or Contention; or contempt of others; or for Profit; or Fame; or for Honor, and Promotion; or ſuch like adulterate or inferior ends: but for the merit and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument of Life; and that they regulate and perfect the ſame in charity: <hi>For the deſire of Power, was the Fall of Angels, the deſire of knowledge, the fall of Man; but in charity there is no exceſſe, neither men nor Angels ever incurred danger by it.</hi> § The Requeſts we make are theſe; (To ſay nothing of our ſelves touching the matter in hand) we <hi>Requeſt</hi> thus much, <hi>That men would not think of it as an opinion; but as a work, and take it for Truth, that our aime, and end is not to lay the foundation of a Sect or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit, but of Humane Profit and Proficience.</hi> § A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that reſpecting their own Benefit, and putting off Partialities and Prejudices, they would all contribute in one for the publique Good: and that being freed and fortified by our Preparations and Aids, againſt the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and Impediments of the waies, they likewiſe may come in, and bear a part in the burden, and inherit a portion of the Labours that yet remaine behind. § Moreover that they cheere up themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive well of the enterpriſe; and not figure unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a conceit and fancy, <hi>that this Our Inſtauration is a matter infinite, and beyond the power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſse of Mortality;</hi> ſeeing it is in truth the right and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150781:32"/> legitimate end and period of <hi>Infinite Errors</hi> and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of Mortality, and Humane Condition, being it doth not promiſe that the <hi>Deſigne</hi> may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht within the Revolution of an Age only, but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it over to Poſterity to Perfect.

That <hi>vulgare Logique</hi> profeſſes the Preparation and Contrivance of aides and forces for the underſtanding, herein they conſpire, but it cleerely differs from the Populare, ſpecially in three things, namely, <hi>in the end, in the order of Demonſtrating, and, in the firſt diſcloſures to Inquiry.</hi> § For <hi>the End</hi> propounded in this our Science is, that there may be found out not Arguments, but Arts; not things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentaneous to Principles, but even Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; not probable reaſons, but deſignations and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of works; wherefore from a different intention followes a different effect: for there, an Adverſary is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed and vanquiſht by Diſputation, here by nature, the thing done. § <hi>And with this End accords the nature and order of their Demonſtrations:</hi> For in <hi>vulgare Logique,</hi> almoſt all the paines is imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150781:34"/> 
                  <hi>Syllogiſme:</hi> as for <hi>Induction,</hi> the <hi>Dialectiques</hi> ſeem ſcarce ever to have taken it into any ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſlightly paſsing it over, and haſtning to the formes of Diſputeing But we reject <hi>Demonſtration by Syllogiſme,</hi> for that it proceeds confuſedly; and lets nature eſcape our hands. For though no man call into doubt, but that <hi>what are coincident in a midle terme, are in themſelves coincident,</hi> (which is a kind of Mathematique Certitude) yet here lies the Fallax, <hi>that Syllogiſme conſiſts of Propoſitions, Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of words, and words are the tokens and marks of things.</hi> Now if theſe ſame <hi>notions</hi> of the the mind, (which are as it were, <hi>the ſoule of words,</hi> and the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of this manner of ſtructure, and fabrique) be rudely and raſhly divorc'd from things, and roveing; not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly defin'd and limited, and alſo many other waies vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious; all falls to ruine. Wherefore we reject <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme,</hi> not only in regard of <hi>Principles</hi> (for which nor doe they make uſe of it) but in reſpect alſo of <hi>Midle Propoſitions,</hi> which indeed <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres and brings forth; but barren of operations and remote from practiſe; and in relation to the Active Part of Sciences, altogether incompetent. Although there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may leave to <hi>Syllogiſme,</hi> and ſuch celebrated and applauded <hi>Demonſtrations,</hi> a juriſdiction over Arts Populare and Opinable (for in this kind we move nothing) yet for the nature of Things, we every where as well in <hi>Minor, as Maior Propoſitions,</hi> make uſe of <hi>Inductions:</hi> for we take <hi>Induction</hi> to be that Forme of <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> which ſupports ſenſe; preſſes nature
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:150781:35"/> and is inſtanced in works, and in a ſort mingled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. Wherefore the order alſo of <hi>Demonſtration</hi> is altogether inverted. For hetherto the buſineſſe uſed to be thus managed; from ſenſe, and ſome few Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſuddenly to fly up to the higheſt Generalls, as to fixt Poles, about which Diſputations may be turned; from which the reſt of intermediate Axioms may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. A way compendious indeed, but precipitate; and to nature impervious; but for Diſputations ready, and accommodate. But according to <hi>our method, Axioms</hi> are raiſed by a ſequent continuity &amp; graduat dependancy, ſo as there is no ſeiſing upon the higheſt Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls, but in the laſt place; and thoſe higheſt Generals in quality not notionals; but well terminated, and ſuch as nature acknowledges to be truly neere allied unto her; and which cleave to the individuall intrinſiques of things. § <hi>But touching the forme it ſelfe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and Iudgement made by it,</hi> we undertake a mighty work. For the <hi>Forme, whereof Logicians ſpeak, which proceeds by ſimple enumeration, is a childiſh thing,</hi> and concludes upon admittance; is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to perill from a contradictory inſtance; lookes only upon commune operations; and is in the iſſue endleſse. But to the knowledges of <hi>Induction,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Forme</hi> is required, as may ſolve and ſeparate <hi>experience;</hi> and by due excluſion and rejection neceſſarily conclude. And if that publique and populare <hi>Iudgement of Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiques,</hi> be ſo laborious and hath exerciſed ſo many and ſo great wits; how much greater paines ought we take in this other; which not only out of the ſecret cloſets of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150781:35"/> mind, but out of the very entrailes of nature is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? Nor is this all, for we more firmely ſettle, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the foundation of Sciences, and take the firſt riſe of our inquiry deeper than hetherto hath bin attempted; ſubmitting to examinations thoſe Principles, which <hi>vulgare Logick</hi> takes up on the credit of another. For the <hi>Dialectiques</hi> borrow, as it were, from all other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the Principles of Sciences; again adore the prime Notions of the mind; laſtly reſt ſatisfied with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediat informations of ſenſe rightly diſpoſited. But our judgement is this, that true Logique ſhould viſite every particular Province of Sciences, with greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand than their principles poſſeſſe; and that thoſe ſame <hi>putative Principles</hi> be enforc'd to give an account, and be liable to examination, untill ſuch time as their validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and tenure cleerely appeared. And as touching the <hi>Prime Notions of the intellect,</hi> there is nothing of thoſe, (the underſtanding left at liberty to it ſelfe) hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, but matter to be ſuſpected; nor any way warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, unleſse it be ſummon'd, and ſubmit it ſelfe to a new Court of Judicature; and that ſentence paſſe according thereto. Moreover we many waies ſift and ſound the information of ſenſe it ſelfe; for the Sences deceive, yet withall they indicate their Errors: but Errors are at hand, Indications to be ſought for a farre off. § <hi>The guilt of Senſe is of two ſorts; either it deſtitutes us, or elſe it deceives us.</hi> For firſt, there are many things which eſcape the cognizance of ſenſe, even when it is well diſpoſed, and no way impedire: either by reaſon of the ſubtility of the entire body, or the minutneſſe of the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150781:36"/> parts thereof, or the diſtance of place, or the ſlowneſſe, and likewiſe ſwiftneſſe of motion; or the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with the object, or ſome other cauſes. Again, nor where ſenſe truly apprehends its object, are her precepts ſo very firme: <hi>for the teſtimony and information of ſenſe, is ever from the Analogy of Man, and not from the Analogy of the World;</hi> and it is an error of dangerous conſequence to aſſert, <hi>that ſence is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of things.</hi> Wherefore to encounter theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, we have with painfull and faithfull ſervice e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where ſought out, and collected aſsiſtances, <hi>that Supplements to Deficients; to Variations, Rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, may be miniſtred.</hi> Nor doe we undertake this ſo <hi>much by inſtruments, as by experiments;</hi> for the ſubtlety of <hi>Experiments,</hi> is farre greater than of <hi>ſenſe</hi> it ſelfe, though aſsiſted with exact inſtruments; we mean <hi>ſuch experiments,</hi> which to the intention of the thing inquired, are skilfully according to Art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and accommodated. Wherefore we doe not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute much to the immediat and particular perception of ſenſe; but we bring the matter to this iſſue, that ſenſe may judge only of the experiment; the experiment of the thing. We conceive therefore, that of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> (from which all knowledge in things naturall muſt be derived, unleſſe we mean wilfully to goe a witleſse way to worke) we are become the religious Pontifes; and the not inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert interpreters of her Oracles; ſo as others may ſeem in outward profeſsion; but we in deed and action, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and honor <hi>ſenſe.</hi> And of this kind are they which we prepare, for the light of Nature, the accenſion, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:150781:36"/> immiſsion thereof; which of themſelves were ſufficient, were human Intellect equall, and a ſmooth inanticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Table. But when the minds of men are after ſuch, ſtrange waies beſieged, that for to admit the true beams of things, a ſincere and poliſht Area is wanting; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes us, of neceſsity to bethink our ſelves, of ſeeking out ſome remedy for this diſtemperature. The <hi>IDOLAES,</hi> wherewith the mind is preoccupate are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Attracted, or Innate;</hi> Attracted have ſlid into mens minds, either by the <hi>Placits and Sects of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers;</hi> or by <hi>depraved lawes of Demonſtrations.</hi> But the <hi>Innate</hi> inhere in the nature of the Intellect, which is found to be farre more liable to error, than <hi>ſenſe.</hi> For however men may pleaſe themſelves, and be raviſh't into admiration, and almoſt adoration of the mind of man; this is moſt certain: <hi>as an inequall look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſe,</hi> changes the raies of objects, according to its own figure, and cutting; even ſo the mind, when it ſuffers impreſsion from things by ſenſe, in encogitating and diſcharging her notions, doth not ſo faithfully inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and incorporate her nature, with the nature of things. And thoſe two firſt kinds of <hi>IDOLAES</hi> can ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hardly; but thoſe latter, by no means be extirpate. It remains only that they be diſcloſed; and that ſame trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous faculty of the mind be noted and convinced; leſt from the unſound complection of the mind, upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of ancient, perchance new ſhootes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſpring up in their place; and the buſineſſe be brought only to this iſſue; that errors be not extinguiſht, but changed: but that on the contrary, now at last, it be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150781:37"/> for ever decreed and ratified, <hi>that the intellect cannot make a judgement but by Induction,</hi> and by <hi>a legitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate forme thereof.</hi> Wherefore <hi>the Doctrine of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying the underſtanding,</hi> that it may become recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of truth, is perfected by <hi>three Reprehenſions: Reprehenſion of Philoſophy; Reprehenſion of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations;</hi> and <hi>Reprehenſion of Native hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſon.</hi> Theſe explicated, and then the caſe cleered, what the nature of things, what the nature of the mind is capable off; we preſume (the Divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being Preſident at the Rites) that we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and adorned, <hi>the Bride-chamber of the Mind and of the univerſe.</hi> Now may the vote of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-ſong be, <hi>that from this coniunction, Human Aides, and a Race of Inventions may be procreated, as may in ſome part vanquiſh and ſubdue mans mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and neceſsities.</hi> And this is the ſecond Part of the Work.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">P. </seg>III</label> ¶But our purpoſe is not only to point out and munite the way; but to enterpriſe it: <hi>Wherefore the third Part of the work compriſeth, PHaeNOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA VNIVERSI,</hi> as to ſay, <hi>all kind of Experience, and Naturall Hiſtory,</hi> of ſuch kind as may be fundamentall for the building up of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy.</hi> For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any exact way of <hi>Demonſtration or Forme of interpreting Nature,</hi> both guard and ſupport the mind from error and lapſe; and withall preſent and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter matter for knowledge. But they who propoſed to themſelves not to proceed by Conjectures and Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but to find out, and to know, whoſe end and aime
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150781:37"/> is not to contrive Fictions and Fables, but to ſearch with diligence into the nature of, and, as it were, <hi>anatomize, this true world;</hi> muſt derive all from the very things themſelves. Nor can the ſubſtitution and compenſation of wit, or meditation, or Argumentation ſuffice to this travaile, inquiſition, and mundane perambulation; no not if all the wits in the world ſhould meet together. Wherefore we muſt either take a right courſe, or deſert the buſineſſe for ever: and to this day the matter hath bin ſo managed, that it is no marvaile, if nature hath not diſcloſed hir ſelfe. For firſt, defective and fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous information of ſenſe; negligent, inequall, and as it were, caſuall obſervation; vain Tradition and from idle report; Practiſe, intent on the work, and ſervile; <hi>experimentall attempt,</hi> ignorant, dull, wild, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; laſtly ſlight and poore <hi>Naturall Hiſtory,</hi> have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the raiſing of Philoſophy, congeſted moſt depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved matter for the underſtanding. After this, prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous ſubtlety of arguing, and ventilation, hath eſſayed a late remedy to things plainly deſperate; which doth not any way recover the buſineſſe, or ſeperate errors. § <hi>Wherefore there is no hope of greater advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and progreſſe, but in the Reſtauration of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</hi> And the commencements hereto muſt, by all means, be derived from <hi>Naturall Hiſtory;</hi> and that too, of a new kind and proviſion: for to no purpoſe you poliſh the Glaſſe, if images be wanting: not only faithfull guards muſt be procured, but apt matter prepared. And this our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> as our <hi>Logick,</hi> differs from that in uſe, in many particulars: <hi>in the end or office, in the Maſſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150781:38"/> and Congeries, than in the ſubtilty, alſo in choice, and in conſtitution in reference to thoſe things that follow. § For firſt we propound ſuch a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Hiſtory,</hi> as doth not ſo much either pleaſe for the variety of things, or profit for preſent improvement of Experiments, as it doth diſperſe a light to the invention of cauſes; and gives, as it were, the firſt milke to the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing up of Philoſophy. For though we principally purſue operation, and the Active part of Sciences; yet we attend the due ſeaſon of Harveſt; nor goe about to reap the green hearb or the blade. For we know well that Axioms rightly invented, draw after them the whole troupe of Operations; and not ſparſedly but plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully exhibit works. But we utterly condemne and renounce, as <hi>Atalantaes Apple</hi> which retards the Race, that unſeaſonable and childiſh humor of accelerating erly pledges of new works. And this is the Duty of our <hi>Naturall Hiſtory.</hi> § <hi>As for the Maſſe, we Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile</hi> a Hiſtory, not only of Nature at Liberty, and in Courſe; I mean, when without compulſion ſhe glides gently along, and accompliſhes her own work: (as is the <hi>Hiſtory of the Heavens, Meteors, Earth and Sea; of Minerals, Plants, Animals:</hi>) but much rather of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtraightned and vext;</hi> when by the provocations of Art, and the miniſtry of Man, ſhe is put out of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune road; diſtreſſed and wrought. Wherefore, all the experiments of Arts Mechanicall; all of the Operative part of Liberall; all of many Practicall, not yet conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into a peculiar Art (ſo farre as any diſcovery may be had, and ſo farre as is conducent to our intention) we
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150781:38"/> will ſet down at large. So likewiſe (not to diſſemble the matter) nothing regarding mens pride and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades, we bestow more paines, and place more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in this Part than in that other; being the nature of things, more diſcloſes hirſelfe in <hi>the vexation of Art;</hi> than when it is at its own liberty. § Nor doe we preſent the <hi>Hiſtory of Subſtances only,</hi> but alſo we have taken it as a part of our diligence, to prepare a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>hiſtory of their virtues;</hi> we mean, ſuch as in nature may be accounted Cardinall, and wherein the Primordials of nature are expreſsely conſtituted; as matter inveſted with her Primitive qualities and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; as <hi>denſe, rare, hot, cold, conſiſtent, fluid, ponderous, light,</hi> and others not a few. § For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to ſpeak of <hi>ſubtility, we ſearch out with choice diligence, a kind of Experiments, farre more ſubtile and ſimple than thoſe commonly met with.</hi> For we educe and extract many out of darkneſſe, which had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come into any mans mind to inveſtigate, ſave his who proceeds by a certain and conſtant path, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of cauſes: whereas in themſelves they are of no great uſe; that it is cleerely evident, that they were not ſought after, for themſelves, but that they have directly the ſame reference to things and works, that the Letters of the Alphabet have to ſpeech and words; which, though ſingle by themſelves, they are unprofitable, yet are they the Elements of all Language. § <hi>And in the choice of Reports and Experiments, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that we have given in better ſecurity, than they who hetherto have bin converſant in Naturall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>

So alſo all thoſe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ventilated current fictions and lies, which by a ſtrange neglect, have for many ages bin countenanced and are become inveterate; we doe by name proſcribe, and preciſely note, that they may be no longer prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to Sciences.<note place="margin">Plut. de Ed.

For it came into our mind, that in <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> the frame ſtanding, the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion inferred is facile and perſpicuous; on the contrary, without this accomodation and dependency, all ſeems involved, and more ſubtile than indeed they be. <hi>Wherefore to examples of this ſort we asſigne the Fourth Part of our work;</hi> which indeed is nothing elſe, but a particular, and explicite application of the Second Part.</p>

Wherefore theſe two main Jntentions, <hi>Human Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Human Potencies,</hi> are indeed in the ſame point coincident: and the fruſtration of works, for moſt part, falls out from the ignorance of Cauſes. § But herein the ſumme and perfection of all conſiſts, if a man, never taking off the eye of his mind from the things themſelves, throughly imprint their images to the life. For God defend, that we ſhould publiſh the ayery dreams of our own Fancy, for the reall <hi>Ideas of the World!</hi> But rather may he be ſo graciouſly propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto us, that we may write the Apocalyps, and true viſion of the impreſsions and ſignets of the Creator, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creature!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore thou, O Father, who haſt conferred vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Light as the Primitiae on the Creature; and breathed into the face of Man Intellectuall Light, as the accompliſhment of thy works; protect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct this Work, which iſſueing from thy Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, returnes to thy Glory!

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE were under the Old Law (Excellent KING) both <hi>Free-will Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi> and <hi>Daily Sacrifices;</hi> the one proceeding upon ordinary obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; the other upon a Devout Cheerfulneſſe. Certainly, in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, ſome ſuch kind of Homage belongs to KINGS from their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, namely, that every one ſhould tender, not only Tributes of his Duty, but Preſents of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:150781:61"/> Affection. In the former of theſe, I hope, I ſhall not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for the latter I was in ſuſpenſe what I ſhould moſt principally undertake, and in concluſion I thought it more reſpective to make choice of ſome oblation, which might referre, rather to the propriety and excellency of Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall perſon, than to the buſineſſe of Your Crowne and State.</p>
               <p>§ Repreſenting Your Majeſty, as my duty is, many times unto my mind, (leaving aſide the other parts whether of Your Vertue, or of Your Fortune,) I have been poſſeſt with extream wonder, when I conſider the excellency of thoſe vertues and faculties in You, which the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call intellectuall; the capacity of Your mind compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending ſo many and ſo great Notions; the faithfulneſſe of Your memory; the ſwiftneſſe of Your apprehenſion; the penetration of Your judgement; the order and facility of Your elocution. In truth <hi>Plato's</hi> opinion ſometimes comes into my mind, which maintaines, <hi>That knowledge is nothing elſe but remembrance;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Phaedo.</note> 
                  <hi>and that the mind of man by nature knowes all things, once redimed and reſtored to her own native light, which the cloudy vault, or gloomy Tabernacle of the body had or e-ſpread with darkneſſe.</hi> For certainly the beſt and cleareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for this aſſertion ſhines in Your Majeſty, whoſe mind is ſo ready to take flame from the leaſt occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, or the leaſt ſpark of anothers knowledge delivered. Wherefore as the ſacred, Scripture ſaith of the wiſeſt King, <hi>That his heart was as the ſands of the ſea:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. 4.</note> which though it be one of the largeſt bodies, yet it conſiſteth of the ſmalleſt por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo hath God given Your Majeſty a compoſition of underſtanding exceeding admirable, being able to compaſſe and comprehend the greateſt matters, and nevertheleſſe, to apprehend the leaſt, and not to ſuffer them to eſcape Your obſervation: whereas it ſhould ſeem very difficult, or rather an impoſsibility in nature, for the ſame inſtrument to make it ſelfe fit for great and ſmall works. And for Your gift of Speech, I call to mind what <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus Caeſar,</hi>

                  <hi>Augusto</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prompta ac profluens, qúae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceret
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:150781:61"/> principem, eloquentia fuit.</hi> In truth if we note it well, ſpeech that is <hi>Elaborate,</hi> or <hi>Affectate,</hi> or <hi>Jmitating,</hi> although otherwiſe excellent, hath ſomewhat ſervile in it and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the ſubject; but Your Majeſties manner of ſpeech is indeed Prince-like, flowing as from a fountaine, and yet ſtreaming and branching it ſelfe into natures order, full of facility and felicity, <hi>Imitating none, &amp; Inimitable of any.</hi> And as in Your Civill eſtate, reſpecting as well Your Kingdome as Your Court, there apeareth to be an Emulation and Contention of Your Majeſties Vertue with Your Fortune, namely excellent Morall endowments with a fortunate Regiment; a Pious and Patient expectation when time was, of Your greater fortune, with a proſperous and ſeaſonable poſſeſsion of what was expected; a Holy obſervation of the lawes of Marriage, with a bleſſed and happy fruit of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in a moſt faire Progeny; a Godly propenſion and moſt beſeeming a Chriſtian Prince to Peace, with a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate concurrence of the like inclination in Your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes: ſo likewiſe in Your intellectuall abilities, there ſeemeth to be no leſſe Contention and Emulation, if we compare Your Majeſties gifts of Nature with the rich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of multiplicious Erudition and the knowledge of many Arts. Neither is it eaſy to finde any KING ſince Chriſts time, which may be compared with Your Majeſty for variety and improvement of all kind of learning Divine and Humane; let who will revolve and peruſe the ſucceſsion of Kings and Emperours, and he ſhall finde this judgement is truly made. For indeed it ſeemeth much in Kings, if by the compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extraction of other mens wits and Labours, they can take hold of knowledge, or attain any ſuperficiall orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſhewes of learning; or if they countenance and preferre learned men; but for a King and a King borne to drink indeed the true fountaines of Learning, nay to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a fountaine of Learning, is almoſt a Miracle. And this alſo is an acceſſe to Your Majeſty, that in the ſame cloſet of your Mind, there are treaſured up as well Divine and Sacred Literature, as Prophane and Humane; ſo that Your Majeſty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150781:62"/> ſtands inveſted with that triplicity of Glory, which was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to that famous <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus, The Power of a King; The Jllumination of a Prieſt; The Learning of a Philoſopher.</hi> Wherefore ſince in theſe glorious attributes of Learning, ſo inherent and individuall in Your Perſon, Your Majeſty ſo farre excells all other Kings, it is very meet that ſuch rare endowments of Nature and Art ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, not only in the fame and admiration of the preſent time, or in the light of Hiſtory conveyed over to Poſterity, but be engraven in ſome ſolid worke, which both may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the power of a great King, and bear a Character or Signature of ſo excellent a learned King. Now (to returne to our intended purpoſe) I concluded with my ſelfe that I could not make to Your Majeſty a better oblation, then of ſome Treatiſe tending to that end.</p>
               <p>§The ſumme and Argument hereof, will conſiſt of <hi>two Parts: In the Former,</hi> which is more ſlight and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (yet may not be paſt over) we ſhall entreat of the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Knowledge and Learning, through all the parts thereof;</hi> and likewiſe of the <hi>merit of thoſe who have wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and wiſely imployed and placed their bomnties and induſtries in the Augmentation, and Propagation thereof. In the latter Part</hi> (which is the main and ſumme of this worke) <hi>I ſhall propound and ſet down what in this kind hath bin embraced, undertaken and accompliſht hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, for the Advancement of Learning: and again briefly touch at ſuch particulars as ſeem Deficient in this enterprize;</hi> to the end that though I dare not preſume poſitively to ſeparate and ſelect what I would chiefly commend unto Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; yet by repreſenting many and different obſervations, I may excite Your Princely cogitations to viſit the peculiar treaſures of Your own mind, and thence to extract what is moſt conducent to the <hi>amplifying and enlarging of the bounds of Arts and Knowledges,</hi> agreeable to Your Magnanimity and Wiſdome.</p>
               <p n="1">I In the entrance to the <hi>former Part,</hi> to cleere the way, and as it were, to make ſilence, to have the teſtimonies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150781:62"/> the <hi>Dignity</hi> of Learning to be better heard, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the interruption of tacite objections, I think good firſt to deliver Learning from the Diſcredits and Diſgraces which Ignorance hath caſt upon it, but Ignorance ſeverally diſguiſed; appearing and diſcovering it ſelf ſometime in the <hi>zeale of Divines;</hi> ſometimes in the <hi>arrogancy of Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>in the errors of Learned men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> I heare the former ſort ſay, <hi>That Knowledge is of the nature and number of thoſe things, which are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with great Limitation and Caution; That the aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to overmuch knowledge, was the originall tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſinne, whereupon enſued the Fall of Man; And that even at this day Knowledge hath ſomewhat of the Serpent in it, and therefore where it entreth into a man, it makes him ſwell, Scientia inflat;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> That <hi>Solomon</hi> gives a cenſure, <hi>That there is no end of making Bookes, and that much reading is a wearineſſe to the fleſh;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.</note> and againe in another place, <hi>That in ſpacious knowledge there is much contriſtation, &amp; that he that encreaſeth knowledge, encreaſeth anxiety;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.</note> That S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives a caveat, <hi>That we be not ſpoild through vain Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloſ. 2.</note> And that experience demonſtrates how the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt men have been Arch heretiques; How Learned times have been inclined to Atheiſme; and how the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſecond Cauſes, doth derogate from the Authority of the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">II To diſcover then the error and ignorance of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and the miſunderſtanding in the grounds thereof, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man may ſee plainly that theſe men doe not obſerve and conſider, That it was not that <hi>Pure and Primitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature,</hi> by the light whereof man did give names to other Creatures in Paradiſe, as they were brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, according to their Proprieties, which gave the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to the Fall; but it was that proud knowledge of <hi>Good and Evill,</hi> with an intent to ſhake of God and to give Law unto himſelfe. Neither is it any <hi>Quantity of Knowledge;</hi> how great ſoever, that can make the mind of man to ſwel; for nothing can fill, much leſſe extend the ſoule of man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:150781:63"/> but God, and the contemplation of God: therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaking of the two Principall ſenſes of Inquiſition, the Eye and the Eare,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.</note> affirmes <hi>That the Eye is never ſatisfied with ſeeing, nor the Eare with hearing;</hi> and if there be no fulneſſe, then is the Continent greater then the Content. So of Knowledge it ſelfe &amp; the Mind of Man, whereto the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are but Reporters, he defines like wiſe in the words plac't after the Calendar or Ephemerides which he makes of the diverſity of times and ſeaſons for all Actions and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.</note> concluding thus, <hi>God hath made all things Beautifull and Decent in the true returne of their ſeaſons; alſo he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the world in mans heart, yet cannot man finde out the worke which God worketh from the beginning unto the end:</hi> By which wordes he declares, not obſcurely, that God hath framed the Mind of Man, as a Mirror or Glaſſe capable of the Image of the univerſall world, and as joyfull to receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions thereof, as the eye joyeth to receave light; and not only delighted in the beholding, the variety of things and the viciſitude of times, but raiſed alſo to finde out and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the inviolable lawes and the infallible decrees of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And although he ſeem to inſinuate that the ſupreme or ſummary law of Nature, which he calleth <hi>the worke which God worketh from the beginning to the end,</hi> is not poſsible to be found out by man, yet that doth not derogate from the Capacity of the Mind, but may be referred to the impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of knowledge, as the ſhortneſſe of life, the ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of labours deprav'd, and unfaithfull Tradition of knowledge over from hand to hand; and many other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences wherewith the condition of man is enſnared and involv'd. For that no parcell of the world is denied to mans inquiry, or invention he cleerly declares in another place, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">Prov. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>The ſpirit of a man is as the Lamp of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he ſearcheth the inwards of all ſecrets.</hi> § If then ſuch be the capacity and receipt of the mind of man, it is manifeſt that there is no danger at all from the <hi>Proportion</hi> or <hi>Quantity</hi> of <hi>knowledge</hi> how large ſoever, leſt it ſhould make it ſwell or outcompaſſe it ſelfe, but meerly in the <hi>Quality,</hi> which being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:150781:63"/> in Quantity more or leſſe, if it be taken without the true Corrective thereof, hath in it ſome nature of malignity, or venome full of flatuous ſymptomes. This Antidote, or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective ſpice, the mixture whereof tempers knowledge and makes it ſo ſoveraigne is <hi>Charity,</hi> which the Apoſtle imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly addes in the former clauſe, ſaying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Knowledge blowes up, but Charity builds up;</hi> Not unlike to that which he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in an other place,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>If J ſpake</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with the tongues of Men and Angels and had not Charity, it were but as a tinkling Cymball:</hi> Not but that it is an excellent thing to ſpeak with the tongus of Men and Angels, but becauſe if it be ſever'd from <hi>Charity,</hi> and not referr'd to the publique good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, it rather exhibites a vaine and empty glory, then any ſubſtantiall and ſolid fruit.</p>
               <p n="3">III As for that Cenſure of <hi>Salomon, concerning the exceſſe of writing and reading Bookes, and the anxiety of ſpirit which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doundeth from Knowledge,</hi> and that admonition of S. <hi>Paul, that we be not ſeduced by vain Philoſophy;</hi> if thoſe places be rightly underſtood, they doe very excellently ſet forth the true bounds and limitations, whereby humane knowledge is confin'd and circumſcribed, yet ſo as without any ſuch contracting and coaretation, it may comprehend all the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall nature of things. Theſe limitations are three. <hi>The firſt that we doe not ſo place our felicity in knowledge, as we frrget our Mortality. The ſecond, that we make application of our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to give our ſelves repoſe and contentment and not diſtaſt or repining. The third, that we doe not preſume by the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of nature, to attaine the Myſteries of God.</hi> § For as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>the first, Salomon</hi> doth excellently expound himſelfe in the ſame Book, <hi>I ſaw well,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that knowledge recedes as farre from ignorance as light doth from darkneſſe, and that the wiſe mans eyes keep watch in his head, whereas the foole roundeth about in darkneſſe, but withall I learned that the ſame mortality involves them both.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>For the ſecond,</hi> certain it is no anxiety, or perturbation of mind reſulteth from knowledge, otherwiſe then meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by accident: For all knowledge and wonder (which is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:150781:64"/> the ſeed of knowledge,) is an impreſsion of pleaſure in it ſelfe; but when we fall to framing concluſions out of our knowledge which obliquely applied to our particular pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, either miniſter weak feares or vaſt deſires, then there growes that vexation and trouble of Mind, whereof we ſpeake: for then knowledge is no more <hi>Lumen ſiccum,</hi> as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> the <hi>Profound</hi> would have it, <hi>Lumen ſiccum optima a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima,</hi> but it becomes <hi>Lumen madidum, or maceratum,</hi> being ſteeped and infuſed in the humors of the affections.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The third rule</hi> deſerves a litle to be ſtood upon, and not to be lightly paſſed over: For if any man ſhall think by view and enquiry into theſe ſenſible and materiall things, to attain that light whereby he may reveale unto himſelfe the nature and will of God, then indeed, <hi>is he ſpoil'd through vain Philoſophy.</hi> For the contemplation of the creatures, having regard to the creatures themſelves, produceth Knowledge, but having regard to God, wonder only, which is a broken Knowledge. And therefore it was moſt aptly ſaid by one of <hi>Plato's</hi> ſchoole,<note place="margin">Philo. Iud. de Somniis.</note> 
                  <hi>That the ſenſe of man carries a reſemblance with the ſunne, which opens and reveales the terreſtriall Globe, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceales and ſeales up the ſtarres and celestiall Globe:</hi> ſo doth the ſenſe diſcover naturall things, but it darkens and ſhuts up divine. And hence it hath proceeded, that ſome of the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ranke of the more Learned have faln into Hereſy, whilſt they have ſought to fly up to the ſecrets of the Deity, by the waxen wings of the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>§ As for the conceit of thoſe who are of opinion that <hi>too much knowledge ſhould encline the mind to Atheiſme, and that the ignorance of the ſecond Cauſes, ſhould be, as it were, a Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife to our Piety towards the firſt.</hi> I would willingly charge theſe in the language of <hi>Iob,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Will you lye for God as one man doth for another to gratify him?</hi> For certain it is that God works nothing in nature according to ordinary courſe but by ſecond cauſes, and if they would have it otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, it is meere impoſture, under colour of Piety to God, and nothing elſe but to offer unto the Author of Truth the unclean ſacrifice of a Lye. But farther, it is an aſſured truth
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:150781:64"/> and a concluſion of Experience, That a litle or ſuperficiall taſt of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> may perchance incline the Mind of Man to <hi>Atheiſme;</hi> but a full draught thereof brings the mind back againe to Religion. For in the entrance of Philoſophy, when the ſecond cauſes, which are next unto the ſenſes, doe offer themſelves to the mind of Man, and the mind it ſelfe cleaves unto them and dwells there, an oblivion of the higheſt cauſe may creep in, but when a man paſſeth on farther and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the dependency, continuation and confederacy of cauſes, and the workes of Providence,<note place="margin">Homer. Iliad 9.</note> than according to the allegory of the Poets, he will eaſily believe that the <hi>highest linke of Natures chaine muſt needs be tyed to the foot of Iupiters chaire.</hi> To cloſe in a word, let no man upon a weak conceit of ſobriety or ill applied moderation, thinke or maintaine that a man can ſearch too farre, or be too well ſtudied <hi>in the Book of Gods word,</hi> or in <hi>the Booke of Gods workes; Divinity</hi> or <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> but rather let men awake themſelves and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour, and purſue an endleſſe progreſſe or profici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in both: only let them beware leſt they apply Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to <hi>ſwelling,</hi> not to <hi>charity;</hi> to <hi>oſtentation</hi> not to <hi>uſe:</hi> and againe, that they doe not unwiſely mingle and confound theſe diſtinct Learnings of <hi>Theology</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and their ſeverall waters together.</p>

                     <l>Hae tibi erunt Artes —</l>
                  </q> And we ſee that <hi>Anytus</hi> the accuſer of <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato. Apol.

               <p n="2">II But theſe and the like imputations have rather a countenance of Gravity, then any ſyncerity of truth: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience doth witneſſe that the ſelfe-ſame perſons, and the ſelfe-ſame times, have flouriſht in the <hi>glory of Armes and Learning.</hi> As for men, we may inſtance in that noble paire of Emperors <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caeſar the Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> the one was <hi>Ariſtotle's</hi> ſcholler in Philoſophy; the other <hi>Cicero's Rivall</hi> in eloquence. But if any man had rather call for Schollers that have become great Generalls, then Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls that were great Schollers, let him take <hi>Epaminondas</hi> the Theban, or <hi>Xenophon</hi> the Athenian; whereof, the one was the firſt that abated the power of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and the other was the firſt that made way to the overthrow of the <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of Perſia.</hi> And this <hi>conjunction of Armes and Letters,</hi> is yet more viſible in times then in perſons, by how much an age is a greater object then a man: For the ſelfe-ſame times with the <hi>Aegyptians, Aſſyrians, Perſians, Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Romanes,</hi> that are moſt renowned for <hi>Armes,</hi> are likewiſe moſt admired for <hi>Learning;</hi> ſo that the graveſt Auctors and Philoſophers, the greateſt Captaines and Governors have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the ſame Ages. Neither indeed can it otherwiſe be, for as in man the ripeneſſe of the ſtrength of the body and the minde comes much about one age, ſave that the ſtrength
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150781:66"/> of the body comes ſomewhat the more early; So in ſtates, the glory of Armes, and <hi>Learning</hi> (whereof the one corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondeth to the body, the other to the ſoule of man) have a concurrence, or a neere ſequence of Time.</p>
               <p n="3">III Now for <hi>matter of Policy and Government,</hi> that <hi>Learning</hi> ſhould rather be an <hi>impediment, then an adiument</hi> thereunto is a thing very improbable. We all confeſſe that it is an unadviſed Act to commit a naturall body, and the cure of Health, to <hi>Emperique Phyſitians,</hi> who commonly have a few receipts which ſeem to them to be univerſall Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, whereupon they are confident and adventurous, when yet they neither know the cauſes of Diſeaſes, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions of Patients, nor the perill of Symptomes, nor the Method of Cures. We ſee it a like error in thoſe, who for expedition of their cauſes, and ſuites rely upon petty Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and Lawyers, which are only men of Practice, and not grounded in their bookes, who are many times eaſily ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, when a new caſe falls out beſides the common Roade of their experience: ſo by like reaſon it cannot but be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of doubtfull conſequence, if ſtates be managed by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirique States-men. On the contrary it is almoſt without inſtance, that ever any Goverment was diſaſterous, that was in the hand of Learned Governours. For howſoever it hath bin ordinary with Politique men to extenuate, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Learned men by the name of Pedants, yet Hiſtory, which is the miſtreſſe of Truth makes it appeare in many particulars, that the government of Princes in minority, hath farre excelled the Government of Princes of mature age, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for that reaſon which Politiques ſeeke to traduce, which is that by that occaſion the State hath bin in the hands of Pedants. Who knowes not that for the firſt five years ſo much magnified during the minority of <hi>Nero,</hi> the Burden of the ſtate was in the hands of <hi>Seneca</hi> a <hi>Pedanti?</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Gordianus</hi> the yonger owes the ten years applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded government to <hi>Miſitheus</hi> a <hi>Pedant.</hi> And with the like happineſſe <hi>Alexander Severus</hi> govern'd the ſtate in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, in which ſpace women rul'd all, but by the advice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:150781:66"/> and councell of preceptors, and teachers. Nay let a man look into the Government of the <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> as by name, into the government of <hi>Pius Quinctus,</hi> or <hi>Sextus Quinctus</hi> in our times, who were both at their entrance eſtimed but as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danticall Friers;</hi> and he ſhall finde, that ſuch <hi>Popes</hi> doe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, and proceed upon truer principles, than thoſe which have aſcended to the Papacy from an education, and breeding, in affaires of eſtate and Courts of Princes. For though men bred in learning are perchance, not ſo quick, and nimble in apprehending occaſions, and accommodating for the preſent to points of convenience, which the Italians call RAGIONI DI STATO, the very name whereof <hi>Pint Quintus</hi> could not heare with patience, but was wont to ſay, <hi>that they were the inventions of wicked men,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Platon.</note> 
                  <hi>and repugnant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the morall virtues;</hi> yet in this there is made ample recompence, that they are perfect and ready, in the ſafe and plain way of Religion, Iuſtice, Honeſty, and the Morall vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; which way, they that conſtantly keep and perſue, ſhall no more need thoſe other Remedies, then a ſound body need Phyſique. And beſides the ſpace of one mans life can not furniſh preſidents enough to direct the event of but one mans life. For as it hapneth ſometimes that the great Grand-child, Nephew, or <hi>Pro-nephew</hi> reſembleth the Grand-father, or great Grand-father more then the Father; ſo many times it comes to paſſe, that the occurrences of preſent times may ſort better with ancient examples, then with thoſe of later, or immediat times. Laſtly the wit of one man can no more countervaile the latitude of Learning, than one mans meanes can hold way with a common purſe.</p>
               <p n="4">IV And were it granted that thoſe <hi>ſeducements</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſitions</hi> imputed to Learning, by Politicks, were of any force and validity, yet it muſt be remembred with all, that <hi>Learning</hi> miniſtreth in every of them, greater ſtrength of medicin or remedy, then it offereth cauſe of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition</hi> or <hi>infirmity.</hi> For if that <hi>Learning</hi> by a ſecret influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and operation makes the mind <hi>irreſolute and perplext,</hi> yet certainly by plain precept it teacheth how to unwinde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150781:67"/> the thoughts, how farre to deliberate, when to reſolve; yea it ſhewes how to protract, and carry things in ſuſpenſe without prejudice till they reſolve.</p>
               <p>§ Be it likewiſe granted that <hi>Learning makes the minds of men more peremptory and inflexible,</hi> yet withall it teacheth what things are in their nature demonſtrative, and what are conjecturall; and propounds as well, the uſe of diſtinctions, and exceptions, as the ſtability of rules and principles.</p>
               <p>§ Be it againe, <hi>that learning miſleades and wresteth mens mindes, whether by diſproportion, or diſsimilitude of examples,</hi> I know not, yet I know well that it unfoldeth, and laies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen as well the force of circumſtances, as the errors of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, and the cautions of applications; ſo that in all theſe it doth more rectify mens mindes, then pervert them. And theſe remedies <hi>Learning</hi> doth every way convay and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate by the quick penetration, and forcible variety of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Let a man look into the errors of <hi>Clement</hi> the VII, ſo lively deſcribed by <hi>Guicciardine,</hi> who ſerved under him; or into the errors and waverings of <hi>Cicero,</hi> painted to the life by his own penſill, in <hi>his Epiſtles to Atticus,</hi> and he will fly a pace from being inconſtant and irreſolute in his deſignes. Let him look into the errors of <hi>Phocion,</hi> and he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware how he be obſtinate or inflexible. Let him read the fable of <hi>Jxion,</hi> and it will diſpell vaporous hopes and ſuch like fumes and clouds. Let him behold <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> and he will never be one of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> to tread oppoſite to the preſent world.</p>
               <p>§ Now for the conceit, <hi>That learning ſhould be a friend to ſloth, and ſhould oreſpread the mind with a ſweet ſlumber of repoſe and retiredneſſe;</hi> it were a ſtrange thing, if that which accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtometh the minde to a perpetuall agitation, ſhould be the <hi>Patroneſſe to ſlothfulneſſe:</hi> whereas contrariwiſe it may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, that no kinde of men love buſineſſe for it ſelfe, but thoſe that are <hi>Learned;</hi> for other Perſons love affaires and buſineſſe for the <hi>Profit,</hi> as hirelings the worke, for the wages; others for <hi>Honor,</hi> for while they are in Action, they live in the eyes of men and refreſh their reputation, which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:150781:67"/> otherwiſe would weare; others for <hi>Power</hi> and the <hi>Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Fortune,</hi> that they may pleaſure their friends, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure their foes; others that they may <hi>exerciſe ſome facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherein they take a pride,</hi> and in this imagination, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their thoughts in a good humor and pleaſing conceit towards themſelves; others <hi>to advance other ends:</hi> ſo that as it is ſaid of untrue valours, that ſome mens valours are in the eyes of thoſe that look on, ſo the induſtry and courage of theſe men ſeemes to aime at this, that others may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud them, or they hugge themſelves in the contemplation of their own deſignements: only <hi>Learned men</hi> love buſineſſe and imployment, as actions agreeable to nature, and no leſſe healthfull to the mind than exerciſe is to the body; taking pleaſure in the Action it ſelfe, and not in the purchaſe: ſo that, of all men living, they are the moſt indefatigable, if it be towards any buſineſſe, which can repleniſh and detaine the mind according to the dignity thereof. And if there be found ſome laborious in reading and ſtudy, and yet idle in buſineſſe, and action, this growes not from learning, but from ſome weakneſſe or ſoftneſſe of body or minde, ſuch as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Controv. lib. 4. Prov.</note> 
                  <hi>Quidam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>tam ſunt umbratiles ut putent in turbido eſſe quicquid in luce eſt.</hi> Well may it be, that ſuch a point of a mans nature may make him give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to learning, but it is not learning that breeds, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants any ſuch point in his nature. But if any man not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding reſolvedly maintaineth, <hi>that Learning takes up too much time which might otherwiſe be better imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> I anſwere, that no man can be ſo ſtraitned and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt with buſineſſe, and an active courſe of life, but may have many vacant times of leaſure, whileſt he expects the returnes and tydes of buſineſſe, except he be either of a very dull temper and of no diſpatch; or ambitious (litle to his credit and reputation) to meddle and ingage himſelfe in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of all natures and matters above his reach. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth therefore to be enquired, in what matter, and how, thoſe ſpaces and times of Leaſure, ſhould be filled up and ſpent; whether in pleaſures or ſtudy; ſenſuality; or contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:150781:68"/> as was well anſwered by <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to <hi>Aeſchines,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.</note> a man given to pleaſure, who when he told him by way of reproach, <hi>that his orations did ſmell of the Lampe, Indeed</hi> (ſaid <hi>Demosthenes) there is great difference between the things that You and I doe by lampe-light:</hi> Wherefore let no man feare leſt learning ſhould <hi>expulſe buſineſſe;</hi> nay rather it will keepe and defend the poſſeſsions of the minde, againſt idleneſſe and pleaſure, which otherwiſe, at unawares, may enter, to the prejudice both of Buſineſſe and Learning.</p>
               <p>§ Againe, whereas they object, <hi>That learning ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine the reverence of Lawes and Government,</hi> it is a meere calumny without all ſhadow of truth: For to ſay that a blind obedience ſhould be a ſurer obligation then an ocular duty, is all one as to ſay, that a blind man may tread ſurer by a guide, then a ſeeing man can with the uſe of a light and his eyes. Nay it is without all controverſie that Learning doth make the mind of man, gentle, ductile, maniable and pliant to government; whereas ignorance makes them churliſh, thwart, and mutinous; which the Records of time doe cleerely manifeſt, conſidering that the moſt unlearned, rude and barbarous times have bin moſt ſubject to ſeditions, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and changes. As for the judgement of <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>Cenſor,</hi> he was well puniſht for his <hi>blaſphemy against learning:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. in M. Cato.</note> For when he was paſt threeſcore years old, he was taken with an extreme deſire to goe to the ſchoole againe, and to <hi>learne the greek tongue;</hi> which doth well demonſtrate that his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cenſure of the Grecian Learning was rather an affected gravity, than the inward ſenſe of his own opinion. As for <hi>Virgil's verſes,</hi> though it pleaſed him to brave the world in takeing to the <hi>Romanes</hi> the <hi>Art of Empire,</hi> and leaving to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all other <hi>Arts,</hi> as popular and ſervile; yet ſo much is manifeſt, that the Romans never aſcended to that <hi>hight of Empire,</hi> till the time they had aſcended to the <hi>hight of Arts.</hi> For in the time of the two firſt <hi>Caeſars,</hi> Perſons moſt perfect in the State-principles of Government, there lived contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, <hi>the beſt Poet, Virgilius Maro; The beſt Historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, Titus Livius; the beſt Antiquary, Marcus Varro; the beſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:150781:68"/> or ſecond Orator Marcus Cicero;</hi> without queſtion the chiefeſt, every one in their ſeverall faculty, that to the memory of man are known. Laſtly, as for the <hi>accuſation of Socrates,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this I ſay, The time muſt be remembred when it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, namely under the <hi>thirty Tyrants,</hi> of all mortalls the bloodieſt, baſeſt and moſt unworthy of Government: which revolution of State &amp; Time was no ſooner over, but <hi>Socrates,</hi> whom they had made a Perſon Criminall, was made a Perſon Heroicall, and his Memory accumulate with all honours divine and humane; and thoſe Diſcourſes of his, which were than termed Corrupting of Manners, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter celebrated by all Poſterity for moſt ſoveraigne medicines of Mind and Manners. And let this ſerve for anſwer to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiques,</hi> which in their humorous ſeverity, or in their feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned gravity, have preſumed to throw imputations upon Learning; which redargution nevertheleſſe, ſave that we know not whether our labours may extend to other ages, ſeems not ſo needfull for the preſent, ſeeing the aſpect and favour of two moſt learned Princes (<hi>Queene</hi> ELIZABETH &amp; <hi>Your Majeſty,</hi> being as <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux, Lucida Sidera,</hi> ſtarres of a moſt benigne influence) hath wrought in us of Britaine, <hi>ſo much love</hi> and <hi>reverence towards Learning.</hi>

               <p n="1">I <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow come we to the third ſort of Diſcredit or Diminution of Credit, that redoundes upon Learning from learned men themſelves, which commonly cleaveth faſteſt. It is derived either from <hi>their
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:150781:69"/> Fortune,</hi> or from <hi>their Manners,</hi> or from <hi>the Nature of their ſtudies;</hi> whereof the firſt is not in their power; the ſecond is not to the point; ſo as the third alone ſeemeth properly to fall into enquiry: but becauſe we are not in hand with the true valew of things, but with popular eſtimation, it will not be amiſſe to inſinuate ſomewhat alſo of the two former.</p>
               <p n="2">II The Derogations therefore, or Diminutions of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit which grow to Learning <hi>from the fortune of Learned men,</hi> are taken either from their <hi>Poverty and ſcarcity of Meanes;</hi> or from their <hi>obſcure and private courſe of Life;</hi> or from the <hi>meanneſſe of imployment wherein they are converſant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ As concerning <hi>Want,</hi> and that uſually is the caſe of Learned men, that they are <hi>poore,</hi> and commonly begin with litle and grow not rich ſo faſt as other men, which convert their labours chiefly to lucre and encreaſe; it were good to leave the common Place in Commendation of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty</hi> to ſome <hi>Frier Mendicant</hi> to handle, (if by their leaves I may be ſo bold) to whom much was attributed by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavell</hi> in this point,<note place="margin">Dell. Hiſt. Fior. lib. 1.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>that the Kingdome of the clergie had bin long before at an end, if the reputation and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards the Poverty of Friers and Monkes, had not borne out the ſcandalls of the ſuperfluities and exceſſes of Biſhops and Praelates:</hi> ſo a man might ſay that the felicity and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Princes and great Perſons, had long ſince turned to Barbariſme and Rudeneſſe, if the <hi>Poverty of Learning</hi> had not kept up civility and honor of life. But without ſuch advantages of hunting after the praiſe thereof, it is worthy obſervation, what a ſacred and reverend thing <hi>Poverty of Fortune</hi> was, for ſome ages in the Roman State, which yet was a State without Paradoxes: For thus ſaith <hi>Titus Livius</hi> in his introduction,<note place="margin">Praef. lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Either my affection to the worke I have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken deceaves me, or there was never State more great, more religious, more richly furniſh't with good preſidents, nor which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varice and riot conquered ſo late, nor where ſo great reverence to Poverty and Parcimony continued ſo long.</hi> So likewiſe after the State of <hi>Rome</hi> was now degenerate, we read that when
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:150781:69"/> 
                  <hi>Caeſar</hi> the <hi>Dictator</hi> took upon him a Reſtauration of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſed ſtate, one of his <hi>confidents</hi> gave him this counſill, That of all Points the moſt ſummary to ſuch a deſignement, as he went about, was by all meanes to take away the eſtimation of wealth, <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe and all other evills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Orat. ad C. Caeſar. Saluſt. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putata.</note> 
                  <hi>together with the reputation of mony ſhall ceaſe, if neither publique Offices nor any other Dignity, which commonly are ſo coveted, were expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſale.</hi> To conclude this point, as it was truly ſaid that <hi>Rubor eſt virtutis Color,</hi> though ſometimes it come from vice;<note place="margin">Laert. in Diog. Cyn.</note> ſo you may truly ſay, <hi>Paupertas eſt virtutis fortuna,</hi> though ſometimes it may proceed from miſgovernment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>providence. Surely this is <hi>Solomons</hi> Cenſure,<note place="margin">Prov. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui feſtinat ad divitias non erit inſons,</hi> and Precept,<note place="margin">Prov. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Buy the truth and ſell it not;</hi> So wiſdome and knowledge judging it right and equall that meanes ſhould be imployed to get Learning, and not Learning be applied to gather up meanes.</p>
               <p>§ To what purpoſe ſhould we ſpeake of the <hi>private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obſcureneſse of life,</hi> which is objected to learned men? It is a Theme ſo common and ſo frequently handled by all, to extoll <hi>Leaſure</hi> and <hi>retiredneſſe,</hi> not taxed with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality and ſloth, before a Civile and Active life; for ſafety, liberty, ſweetneſſe, dignity, or at leaſt freedome from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, as no man handles this ſubject, but handles it well: ſuch a conſonancy it hath to mens conceptions in the expreſsing; and to mens conſent in the allowing. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I will adde, that Learned men forgotten in States, are like the Images of <hi>Caſsius</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> in the funeralls of <hi>Iunia,</hi> of which, not to be repreſented as others were, <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Annal. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Eo ipſo praefulgebant quod non viſebantur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ For <hi>Meanneſſe of imployment aſsigned to Learned men,</hi> that which is moſt traduced to contempt is, That the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of childhood and youth is commonly allotted to them, the contempt of which age is transferred upon the Preceptors or Tutors. But how unjuſt this traducement is, if you will reduce things from popularity of opinion, to meaſure of reaſon, may appeare, in that we ſee men are more carefull what they put into new veſſels, then into a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:150781:70"/> veſſell ſeaſon'd; and more curious what mould they lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a young plant, then a plant corroborate: So as it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the weakeſt termes and times of all things, uſe to have the beſt applications and helps. Harken, if you pleaſe, to the Hebrew Rabbins,<note place="margin">Ioel. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Your young men ſhall ſee viſions, your old men ſhall dreame dreams;</hi> from this Text they collect, that youth is the worthier age, by ſo much as Revelation is more cleare by viſions, then by dreames. And it is worth the note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that however <hi>Pedants</hi> have bin the deriſion and ſcorne of <hi>Theaters,</hi> as the Apes of <hi>Tyranny,</hi> and that the moderne looſeneſſe or negligence hath taken no due regard to the choice of <hi>Schoolemaſters</hi> and <hi>Tutors;</hi> yet it hath bin an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent complaint drawn down from the beſt and wiſeſt times, even to our age, that States were too buſie with their <hi>Lawes</hi> and too negligent in point of <hi>Education.</hi> Which excellent part of Ancient Diſcipline hath bin in ſome ſort revived of late times <hi>by the Colledges of the Ieſuits,</hi> whoſe paines and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence when I conſider, as well in the culture of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as information of manners, the ſaying of <hi>Ageſilaus</hi> touching <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> comes into my mind,<note place="margin">Plut. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſil.</note> 
                  <hi>Talis cum ſis utinam noſter eſſes.</hi> And thus much concerning the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits drawn from the <hi>Fortunes and Condition of Learned men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III As touching the <hi>Manners of Learned men,</hi> it is a thing belonging rather to their individuall Perſons, than their ſtudies and point of learning. No doubt there is found among them, as in all other Profeſsions, and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, men of all temperatures, as well bad as good, but yet ſo, as it is not without truth that is ſaid, <hi>abire studia in mores;</hi> and that Learning and Studies, unleſſe they fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on very depraved diſpoſitions, have an influence and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the manners of thoſe that are converſant in them, to reforme nature and change it to the better.</p>
               <p>§ But upon an attentive and indifferent review, I for my part, can not finde any diſgrace to learning can proceed from the <hi>Manners of Learned men, adherent unto them as they are Learned;</hi> unleſſe peradventure it be a fault (which was the ſuppoſed fault of <hi>Demoſthenes, Cicero, Cato</hi> the <hi>ſecond, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:150781:70"/> and many more) that becauſe the times they read of, are commonly better, than the times they live in; and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties taught, better then the duties practiſed; they <hi>contend too farre, to reduce the corruption of manners to the honesty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and preſcripts, of a too great hight, and to impoſe the Lawes of ancient ſeverity upon diſſolute times:</hi> and yet they have Caveats enow touching this auſterity out of their own ſprings: For <hi>Solon,</hi> when he was asked,<note place="margin">Plut. in Solon.</note> 
                  <hi>Whether he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Citizens the beſt lawes? the beſt</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>of ſuch as they would receive.</hi> So <hi>Plato,</hi> finding that his own heart could not agree with the corrupt manners of his Country, refuſed to beare place or office, ſaying,<note place="margin">In vita. in epiſt. alibi.</note> 
                  <hi>That a mans Country is to be uſed as his Parents were, that is, with perſwaſion and not with violence, by entreating and not by conteſting:</hi> And <hi>Ceſars</hi> counſelor put in the ſame caveat, ſaying,<note place="margin">Orat. ad C. Caeſ. Saluſt. ad ſcripta.</note> 
                  <hi>non ad vetera inſtituta revocans quae jampridem corruptis moribus ludibrio ſunt:</hi> And <hi>Cicero</hi> notes this error directly in <hi>Cato</hi> the <hi>ſecond,</hi> writing to his friend <hi>Atticus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Attic. lib. 2. ep. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Cato optime ſentit ſed nocet interdum Reipub. lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur enim tanquam in Repub. Platonis, non tanquam in fae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e Romuli.</hi> The ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> doth excuſe and expound the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers for going too farre, and being too exact in their Preſcripts, <hi>Theſe ſame Praeceptors and Teachers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro L. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raena.</note> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeem to have ſtretched out the line and limits of Duties ſomewhat beyond the naturall bounds, that when we had laboured to reach the higheſt point of Perfection, we might reſt where it was meet:</hi> and yet himſelfe might ſay, <hi>Monitis ſum minor ipſe meis;</hi> for he ſtumbled at the ſame ſtone, though in not ſo extreme a degree.</p>
               <p>§ Another fault which perchance not undeſervedly is objected againſt Learned men, is this, <hi>that they have preferr'd the honour and profit of their Countrey, and Maſters before their own fortunes and ſafeties.</hi> So <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> to his Athenians,<note place="margin">Oratio: de Corona.</note> 
                  <hi>My Counſells</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if you pleaſe to note it, are not ſuch whereby J ſhould grow great amongſt you, you become litle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Grecians; but they be of that nature as are ſometimes not good for me to give, but are alwaies good for you to follow.</hi> So <hi>Seneca</hi> after he had conſecrated that <hi>Quinquennium Neronis</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:150781:71"/> to the eternall glory of Learned Governors, held on his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and loyall courſe of Good and Free Counſell, after his Maſter grew extremely corrupt to his great perill and at laſt to his ruine. Neither can it be otherwiſe conceived; for Learning endues mens minds with a true ſenſe of the frailty of their Perſons; the Caſualty of fortune; the Dignity of the ſoule; and their vocation: which when they think of, they can by no meanes perſwade themſelves that any <hi>advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own fortunes,</hi> can be ſet down as a true and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy end of their being and ordainement. Wherefore they ſo live, as ever ready to give their account to God, and to their Maſters under God, whether they be Kings or States they ſerve,<note place="margin">Matt. 25.</note> in this ſtile of words, <hi>Ecce tibi Lucrifeci,</hi> and not in that <hi>Ecce mihi Lucrifeci.</hi> But the corrupter ſort of Politiques, that have not their mindes inſtituted and eſtabliſh't in the true apprehenſion of Duties, and the contemplation of good in the univerſality, <hi>referre all things to themſelves,</hi> as if they were the <hi>worlds Center,</hi> and that the <hi>concurrence of all lines ſhould touch in them and their fortunes;</hi> never careing in all tempeſts, what becomes of the Ship, ſo they may retire and ſave them ſelves in the Cock-boate of their own fortune. On the contrary, they that feele the waight of Duty, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the limits of ſelfe love; uſe to make good their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and duties, though with perill: and if they chance to ſtand ſafe in ſeditions and alterations of times and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is rather to be attributed to the reverence which honeſty even wreſteth from adverſaries, than any <hi>verſatile or temporizing advantage in their own carriage.</hi> But for this point of tender ſenſe, and faſt obligation of duty, which without doubt Learning doth implant in the minde, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be taxed and amerced by Fortune; and be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Politiques in the depth of their corrupt principles, as a weake and improvident virtue, yet it will receive an open allowance, ſo as in this matter there needs the leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe or excuſation.</p>
               <p>§ Another fault there is incident to Learned men, which may ſooner be excuſed than denied, namely this; <hi>That
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:150781:71"/> they doe not eaſily apply and accommodate themſelves to perſons with whom they negociate and live:</hi> which want of exact appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ariſeth from two cauſes, <hi>The firſt is, the largeneſſe and greatneſſe of their minds, which can hardly ſtoope and be confined within the obſervation of the nature and custome of one perſon.</hi> It is the ſpeech of a Lover, not of a wiſe man,<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> 
                  <hi>Satis magnum alter alteri theatrum ſumus.</hi> Nevertheleſſe I ſhall yeeld that he that cannot contract the light of his mind, as he doth the eye of his body, as well as diſperſe and dilate it, wants a great faculty for an active courſe of Life. <hi>The ſecond cauſe is the honeſty and integrity of their nature,</hi> which argueth no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hability in them, but a choiſe upon judgement; for the true and juſt limits of obſervance towards any perſon, extend no farther, then ſo to underſtand his inclination and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as to converſe with him without offence; or to be able, if occaſion be offered, to give him faithfull counſill, and yet to ſtand upon reaſonable guard &amp; caution, in reſpect of our ſelves: but to be ſpeculative into others, and to feele out a mans diſpoſition, to the end to know how to worke him, winde him and governe him at pleaſure; is not the part of an ingenious nature, but rather of a heart double and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; which, as in friendſhip, it is want of integrity, ſo to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Princes and Superiors it is want of Duty. For the Cuſtome of the <hi>Levant,</hi> whereby it was accounted a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous offence, to gaze and fixe their eyes upon Princes, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, in the outward ceremony, barbarous, but good in the morall; for it becomes not Subjects by bent and inquiſitive obſervations, to penetrate into the <hi>hearts of Kings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 25.</note> which the Scripture hath declared to be, <hi>inſcrutable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ There is yet another fault with which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Part, which is often noted in Learned men; namely, <hi>that in ſmall and outward matters of behaviour and carriage</hi> (as in countenance, geſture, march, ordinary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the like) <hi>they doe many times faile to obſerve decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and diſcretion;</hi> ſo as the vulgar ſort of capacities make a judgement of them in greater matters, by that which they finde wanting in ſmall and ordinary points of Action. But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:150781:72"/> this prejudication doth oftentimes deceive them: nay let them know, they have their anſwer from <hi>Themistocles,</hi> who being invited to touch a lute, ſaid, arrogantly enough, being applied to himſelfe, but pertinently to the purpoſe in hand, <hi>That he could not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plut. in Themiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>indeed, fiddle, but he knew how to make a ſmall Towne, a great State.</hi> And there are, no doubt, many well ſeen in the Arts of Government, and Policy, which are to ſeeke in ordinary converſation and punctuall occaſions. I referre ſuch ſcoffers to the Elogie <hi>Alcibiades</hi> gave of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Socrates,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato Conv.</note> whom he compar'd to the <hi>Gallipots of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, which on the outſide were drawne with Apes, Owles, and Antiques, but contained within precious liquors and ſoveraigne confections;</hi> acknowledging that to vulgar capacity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular report, he was not without ſome ſuperficiall levities, and deformities, but was inwardly repleniſht with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent powers and virtues. And ſo much touching the Point <hi>of Manners of learned men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ In the mean time I thought good to advertiſe, that I have no purpoſe to give allowance to ſome <hi>baſe and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Conditions of ſome Profeſsours,</hi> whereby they have diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited both Themſelves and Learning: ſuch were thoſe <hi>tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher Philoſophers,</hi> which in the later age of the Roman ſtate; were uſually in the howſes of Great Perſons, whom not improperly you may call <hi>ſolemne Paraſites:</hi> of which kinde <hi>Lucian</hi> makes a merry deſcription of the Philoſopher, that the great Lady took to ride with her in the Coach, and would needs have him carry her litle Dogge <hi>Melitaeus;</hi> which he doing officiouſly and yet uncomely, the page ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing ſaid,<note place="margin">De Merc. conduct.</note> 
                  <hi>I doubt our Philoſopher of a Stoick will turne Cynique.</hi> But above all the reſt, the groſſe and palpable flattery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto many not unlearned have abaſed and abuſed their wits and pens, turning as <hi>Du Bartus</hi> ſaith <hi>Hecuba</hi> into <hi>Helena,</hi> and <hi>Faustina</hi> into <hi>Lucretia,</hi> hath diminiſht the prize and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Learning.</p>
               <p>§ Neither is the <hi>Moderne Dedication of Bookes to Patrons to be Commended;</hi> for that Bookes, ſuch as are worthy the name of Bookes, ought to have no <hi>Patron</hi> but <hi>Truth</hi> and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:150781:72"/> 
                  <hi>Reaſon.</hi> The cuſtome of the Ancients was better, who were wont to <hi>dedicate their writings only to private and equall friends,</hi> or to entitle the Bookes with the names of ſuch friends; or if they Dedicated their Books to Kings or Great Perſons, it was to ſome ſuch as the Argument of the Book was fit and proper for. Theſe and the like Courſes may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve rather reprehenſion than defence.</p>
               <p>§ Nor ſay I this, as if I condemned the <hi>Morigeration and application of Learned men, to men in fortune and place;</hi> for the anſwer was good that <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> made to one that askt him in mockery,<note place="margin">Laert. in Ariſtip.</note> 
                  <hi>How it came to paſſe that Philoſophers were followers of Rich men, and not Rich-men of Philoſophers?</hi> He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſoberly and yet ſharpely, <hi>That it was becauſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers knew well what they had need of, but Rich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did not.</hi> Of like nature was the anſwer which the ſame Philoſopher made when having a Petition to <hi>Dionyſius</hi> and no eare given to him, <hi>he fell downe at his feet in manner of a worſhipper,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Dionyſius ſtaid and gave him the hearing, and granted it:</hi> but a litle after, ſome perſon tender of the honour and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of Philoſophy, <hi>reproved Ariſtippus that he would offer the Profeſsion of Philoſophy ſuch an indignity as for a private ſuite to fall to a Tyrants feet?</hi> to whom he relied; <hi>That was not his fault, but it was the fault of Dionyſius that had his eares in his feet.</hi> Neither was it accounted weakneſſe, but a diſcretion in him that would not diſpute his beſt with <hi>Adrianus Caeſar,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spartian. in Hadrian.</note> excuſing the fact, <hi>That it was reaſon to yeeld to him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thirty Legions.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like <hi>applications and ſtoopeings of Learned men below the termes of Gravity,</hi> at the command of neceſsity or the advantage of occaſion, cannot be condemned; for though they may ſeeme, at firſt ſight, ſomewhat baſe and ſervile, yet in a judgement truly made, they are to be accounted <hi>ſubmiſsions</hi> to the <hi>Occaſion</hi> and not to the <hi>Perſon.</hi>

For we ſee it is the manner of men, eſpecially of envious perſons, to ſcandalize, and deprave that which retaines the State and Virtue, by takeing advantage upon that which is corrupt and degenerate; as the Heathens in the Primitive Church us'd to blemiſh and taint the Chriſtians, with the faults and corruptions of Heretiques: Nevertheleſſe I have no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make any exact animadverſion of the <hi>Errors,</hi> and <hi>Jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments in matters of Learning,</hi> which are more ſecret and remote from vulgar opinion, but only to ſpeak of ſuch as doe fall under a common and popular obſervation, and known, or at leaſt, which recede not farre of therefrom.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I finde therefore chiefly three vanities, and vacuities in Learning, which have given occaſion to the reproach and diſgrace thereof. For <hi>thoſe things</hi> are eſteemed <hi>vaine</hi> which are either <hi>falſe,</hi> or <hi>frivolous;</hi> namely, wherein there is, either no truth, or no uſe: <hi>thoſe Perſons</hi> we eſteeme vaine, which are either <hi>Credulous</hi> in things falſe, or <hi>Curious</hi> in things of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:150781:73"/> uſe. And <hi>Curioſity</hi> is either in <hi>matter</hi> or in <hi>words;</hi> that is when either labour is ſpent in <hi>vaine matters,</hi> or time is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted in the delicacy of <hi>fine words:</hi> ſo that it is agreeable as well to true reaſon as approved experience, to ſet down three diſtempers of Learning; The firſt is <hi>Phantaſticall Learning;</hi> The ſecond <hi>Contentious Learning;</hi> The third <hi>Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>Delicate Learning:</hi> or thus, <hi>vaine Jmaginations, vaine Altercations, vaine Affectations.</hi> And with the Laſt I will beginne.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This Diſtemper ſeated in the <hi>ſuperfluity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeneſſe of ſpeech</hi> (though in times paſt by turnes, it was in ſome price) about <hi>Luthers</hi> time, got up mightily into credit, and eſtimation. The heat and efficacy of Preaching, to winne and draw on the people, began chiefly about that time to floriſh; and this required a popular kind of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This was furtherd by the Enmity and Oppoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved in that ſame age againſt the <hi>Schoolemen;</hi> whoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were altogether in a differing ſtile and forme of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; taking liberty to coine and frame new and rude termes of Art, whithout any regard to the pureneſſe and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy of ſpeech, ſo they might avoid circuit of words, and deliver their ſenſe and conceptions, in a preciſe exact expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: and ſo it came to paſſe a litle after, that a greater care was taken for Words, than Matter; and many affected ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Comptneſſe of ſtile; a round and clean Period; the ſweet falling of the clauſes; and illuſtrations by Tropes and Figures; than the waight of Matter, ſoundneſſe of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, life of Invention, or depth of Judgement. Then ſprang up the <hi>flowing and watery veine of Oſorius,</hi> the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Biſhop, to be in price and requeſt: Then did <hi>Sturmius</hi> ſpend ſuch infinite and curious paines upon <hi>Cicero</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and <hi>Hemogines</hi> the Rhetorician. Then did our <hi>Carre</hi> and <hi>Aſcham</hi> in their Lectures and Writings almoſt Deifie <hi>Cicero,</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> and allure young Students to that poliſht and floriſhing kinde of Learning. Then did <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> take occaſion to make that ſcoffing kinde of Echo, <hi>Decem annos conſumpſi in Legendo Cicerone,</hi> to which the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:150781:74"/> Echo anſwered, <hi>One, Aſine.</hi> Than grew the Learning of the Schoolemen to be utterly deſpiſed, as rude and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. In ſumme, the whole inclination and bent of thoſe times was, rather about <hi>Copie</hi> than <hi>Waight.</hi> Here we ſee the firſt <hi>Diſtemper of Learning,</hi> when, as we have ſaid, <hi>men ſtudy Words and not Matter.</hi> Whereof though J have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented examples of late times only, yet ſuch vanities have bin accepted, in ſome degree or other, in ancient times, and will be ſo hereafter. Now it is not poſsible but that this ſhould have an operation to diſcredit and debaſe the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Learning, even with vulgar capacities; when they ſee Learned mens Workes, like the firſt letter of a Patent, which though it be limmed and ſet out with large floriſhes, yet it is but a letter. And it ſeemes to me that <hi>Pigmalions frenzie</hi> is a good Embleme and Portraicture of this vanity; for what are words but the Images of matter, and except they be animated with the ſpirit of reaſon, to fall in Love with them, is all one as to fall in love with a Picture.</p>
               <p>§ But yet notwithſtanding it is a thing not haſtily to be condemned to illuſtrate and poliſh the obſcurity and rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Philoſophy, with the <hi>ſplendor of wordes</hi> and <hi>ſenſible elocution,</hi> For hereof we have great examples in <hi>Xenophon, Cicero, Seneca, Plutarque,</hi> and even in <hi>Plato</hi> himſelfe; and the uſe hereof is great: For though to the ſevere inquiſition of Truth, and the deep progreſſe into Philoſophy, it is ſome hinderance, becauſe it is too early ſatisfactory unto the mind, and quencheth the thirſt and deſire of farther ſearch; yet if a man be to have any uſe of ſuch knowledge in Civill occaſions (of <hi>Conference, Counſill, Perſwaſion, Diſcourſe, and the like</hi>) he ſhall finde all that he deſireth prepar'd and ſet out to his hand in thoſe Auctors. But the exceſſe of this is ſo juſtly contemptible, that as <hi>Hercules,</hi> when he ſaw the Jmage of <hi>Adonis, Venus minion,</hi> in the Temple, ſaid, <hi>Nil ſacries;</hi> ſo there is none of <hi>Hercules</hi> followers in Learning, I mean, the more induſtrious and ſevere inquirers into Truth, but will deſpiſe thoſe <hi>Delicacies</hi> and <hi>Affectations,</hi> as indeed capable of no Divineneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:150781:74"/>
               <p>§ Litle better is that kind of ſtile (yet neither is that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together exempt from vanity) which neer about the ſame time ſucceeded this <hi>Copy</hi> and <hi>ſuperfluity of ſpeech.</hi> The labour here is altogether, <hi>That words may be aculeate, ſentences conciſe, and the whole contexture of the ſpeech and diſcourſe, rather round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into it ſelfe, than ſpread and dilated:</hi> So that it comes to paſſe by this Artifice, that every paſſage ſeemes more witty and waighty than indeed it is. Such a ſtile as this we finde more excesſively in <hi>Seneca;</hi> more moderately in <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plinius Secundus;</hi> and of late it hath bin very pleaſing unto the eares of our time. And this kind of expreſsion hath found ſuch acceptance with meaner capacites, as to be a dignity and ornament to Learning; nevertheleſſe, by the more exact judgements, it hath bin deſervedly deſpiſed, and may be ſet down <hi>as a diſtemper of Learning,</hi> ſeeing it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a hunting after words, and fine placing of them. And thus much of the firſt <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> or <hi>Diſtemper</hi> of Learning.</p>
               <p n="3">III Now followes the diſtemper <hi>ſetled in Matter,</hi> which we ſet down as a <hi>ſecond diſeaſe of Learning,</hi> &amp; have deſigned it by the name of <hi>Contentious ſubtletie;</hi> and this is in nature ſomewhat worſe than that whereof we ſpake even now. For as the ſubſtance of Matter, is better than the beauty of wordes; ſo on the contrary, <hi>vanity of Matter</hi> is more odious than <hi>vanity of words.</hi> Wherein it ſeemeth that the reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not only proper for thoſe times, but Propheticall for the times following; and not only reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Divinity, but extenſive to all knowledge,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Devita prophanas vocum novitates:</hi> For in theſe words he aſsignes two Markes and Badges of ſuſpected and falſified ſcience; The firſt is the <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Strangeneſſe of Termes;</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the <hi>ſtrictneſſe of Poſitions;</hi> which of neceſsity induce oppoſition and ſo Alterations and Queſtions. Certainly like as many ſubſtances in nature, which are ſolid and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, doe many times putrifie and corrupt into wormes; ſo good and ſound Knowledge doth often putrifie and diſſolve into a number of ſubtle, idle, unwholſome, and (as I may
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:150781:75"/> terme them) <hi>vermiculate</hi> Queſtions, which ſeem indeed to have a kind of Motion and Quickneſſe in them, and yet they are unſound and hollow, and of no ſolid uſe. This kind of <hi>Degenerate Learning</hi> corrupting it ſelfe, did chiefly raigne amongſt the <hi>Schoolemen;</hi> who having a bundance of Leiſure, ſharpe, and ſtrong wits, and ſmall variety of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (for their wits were ſhut up within the writing of a few Auctors, chiefly <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> their Dictator, as their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were ſhut up in the cells of Monaſteries and Colledges) and for moſt part ignorant of the Hiſtory either of Nature, or of Time did out of no great Quantity of Matter, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite agitation of their Wit and Phancy, as of the ſpindle, ſpinne out unto us thoſe laborious webbes of Learning, which are extant in their Bookes. For the Wit and Mind of Man, if it worke upon Matter, by contemplating Nature and the Works of God, worketh according to the ſtuffe, and is limited thereby; but if it worketh upon it ſelfe, as the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der workes his webbe,</hi> then it is endleſſe, and brings forth <hi>Cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs of Learning,</hi> indeed admirable for fineneſſe of thred and worke but of no Subſtance and Profit.</p>
               <p>§ This ſame unprofitable <hi>ſubtlety</hi> or <hi>Curioſity,</hi> is of two ſorts; and it is diſcerned either in the ſubject and <hi>Matter</hi> it ſelfe, ſuch as is fruitleſſe <hi>Speculation</hi> or <hi>Controverſy,</hi> whereof there are no ſmall number, both in Divinity and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy; Or in the <hi>Manner</hi> and <hi>Method of handling,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Schoolemen was this; Vpon every Poſition or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion they framed objections, then ſolutions of thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which ſolutions, for the moſt part, were only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions, whereas indeed, the ſtrength of all ſciences, <hi>like the Old mans Fagot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aeſop. Fab Plut. Mor.</note> conſiſteth not in every ſtick a ſunder, but in them all together united in the bonde. For the <hi>Harmony of ſciences,</hi> that is when each part ſupports the other, is and ought to be the true and briefe way of confutation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion of all the ſmaller ſort of objections: but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, if you draw out every Axiome, as the ſticks of a Fagot, one by one, you may eaſily quarrell with them, and bend and break them at your pleaſure. So that as it was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:150781:75"/> ſaid of <hi>Seneca, verborum Minutiis rerum frangit pondera,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Fabius Qu. Inſtit. X.</note> may truly be ſaid of the Schoolemen, <hi>Quaeſtionum Minutiis ſcientiarum frangunt pondera.</hi> For were it not better for a man, in a faire roome to ſet up one great light, or branching candleſtick of lights, whereby all may be ſeene at once, than to goe up and downe with a ſmall watch candle into every corner? And ſuch is their <hi>Method,</hi> that reſteth not ſo much upon evidence of Truth proved by Arguments, Auctorities, Similitudes and Examples; as upon particular Confutations, and Solutions of every ſcruple, cavillation, and objection; thus breeding queſtion upon queſtion; even as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſemblance, <hi>when you carry the light into one corner, you darken the reſt.</hi> So that the <hi>fable</hi> of <hi>Scylla</hi> ſeemes to be a lively image of this kinde of Philoſophy or knowledge, which for the upper part had the ſhape of a comely virgin, but below, <hi>Candida ſuccinctam latrantibus inguina monſtris;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Virg. Buc. Ecl. 6.</note> So you ſhall finde ſome generalties of the Schoolemen, faire and well proportioned, and invented to ſome good purpoſe; but than when you deſcend to diſtinctions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, in ſteed of a fruitfull wombe for the uſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of mans life, they end in monſtrous and barkeing <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</hi> Wherefore it is no marvaile, if this quality of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge fall under, even popular contempt, the people being apt to contemne Truth upon occaſion of Controverſies, and altercations; and to think they are all out of their way, which never meet and agree among themſelves; and when they ſee the digladiations of Learned men, about matters of no uſe or moment, they eaſily fall upon that judgement of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of Syracuſa, <hi>verba iſta ſunt ſenum otioſorum.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Laertius in Plato.</note> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is moſt certain, that if the Schoolemen, to their great thirſt of Truth, and unwearied travaile of wit, had joynd variety, and vniverſality of reading, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, they had certainly proved excellent lights to the great <hi>advancement of all Arts and Sciences.</hi> And thus much of the ſecond Diſeaſe of Learning.</p>
               <p n="4">IV For the third Diſeaſe of Learning which concernes <hi>Deceit or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruth,</hi> it is of all the reſt the fouleſt, as that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:150781:76"/> which doth deſtroy the Nature and eſſentiall forme of Knowledge, which is nothing but a repreſentation of Truth. For the <hi>Truth of Being,</hi> and the <hi>Truth of Knowing</hi> are all one, differing no more than the direct beame, and the beame reflexed. This vice therefore brancheth it ſelfe into two ſorts <hi>Impoſture</hi> and <hi>Credulity;</hi> the one deceives, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is deceived, which although they appear to be of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe nature; the one ſeeming to proceed of Cunning, and the other of Simplicity; yet for the moſt part they doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, for as the verſe noteth,

               </p>
               <p>§ This <hi>facility of Crediting</hi> and accepting all things, though weakly authorized, is of two kindes, according to the nature of the Matter handled, for it is either <hi>beliefe of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,</hi> or (as the Lawyers ſpeak) <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> or <hi>matter of Opinion.</hi> In the former kinde, we ſee with what loſſe and detriment of Credit and Reputation, this error hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd and embaſed much of the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory,</hi> which hath too eaſily received and regiſtred Reports and Narrations of Miracles wrought by Martyrs, Hermites, or Monkes of the Deſert, Anchorites, and other holy men; and of their Reliques, Sepulchers, Chappells, Jmages and Shrines. So in <hi>Naturall Hiſtory,</hi> we ſee many things have bin raſhly, and with litle choice or judgement received and regiſtred; as may appeare in the writings of <hi>Plinius, Carda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Albertus,</hi> and diverſe of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which are every where fraught with forged and fabulous Reports, and thoſe not only uncertaine and untried; but notoriouſly untrue and manifeſtly convicted, to the great derogation of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy</hi> with grave and ſober men. Wherein in truth the wiſdome and integrity of <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth excellently appear,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:150781:76"/> that haveing made ſo diligent and exquiſite a <hi>history of living Creatures,</hi> hath mingled it ſo ſparingly with any vaine or faigned matter; but hath rather caſt all <hi>Prodigious Reports,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Mirab: Auſcult:</note> which he thought worthy the recording into one <hi>commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary;</hi> wiſely diſcerning that matter of manifeſt Truth (which might be the experimentall groundworke whereupon Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Sciences were to be built) ought not unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, to be mingled with matter of doubtfull faith: and yet again things rare and ſtrange, which to many ſeem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are not wholly to be ſuppreſſed or denied to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>§ But that other <hi>Facility of Credit,</hi> which is yeelded, not to <hi>History</hi> and <hi>Reports,</hi> but to <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of two ſorts; either when too much beliefe is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Arts</hi> themſelves, or to certain <hi>Auctors</hi> in any Art. The ſciences themſelves, which hold more of the fancy and of beliefe, then of Reaſon and Demonſtration, are chiefly three <hi>Aſtrologie, Naturall Magique,</hi> and <hi>Alchimie;</hi> of which ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces nevertheleſſe the end and pretences are noble; For <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> profeſſeth to diſcover the influence and domination of the ſuperior Globe, over the inferior: <hi>Magique</hi> propoſeth to it ſelfe to call and reduce Naturall Philoſophy from variety of ſpeculations, to the magnitude of workes: <hi>Alchimie</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to make a ſeparation and extraction of all hetroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and unlike parts of bodies, which in mixture of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are Implicate and Incorporate; and to refine and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bodies themſelves, that are diſtained and ſoiled; to ſet at liberty ſuch as are bound and impriſoned; and to bring to perfection ſuch as are unripe. But the derivations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequtions, which are preſumed to conduce to theſe ends, both in the Theorie and in the Practiſe of <hi>theſe Arts,</hi> are full of <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Vanity.</hi> Nor is the Tradition and manner of Delivery for moſt part ingenious and without ſuſpition, but vail'd over and munited with deviſes and impoſtures.

               <p>§ As for the <hi>overmuch Credit that hath bin given to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in Sciences, whom they have invested with the power of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, that their words ſhould ſtand, and not of Conſuls to give advice;</hi> the dammage is infinite that Sciences have received thereby, as a Principall cauſe that hath kept them low at a ſtay, and that they have lien heartleſſe, without any notable <hi>Growth or Advancement.</hi> For hence it hath come to paſſe, that in <hi>Arts Mechanicall,</hi> the firſt deviſer commeth ſhort, &amp; time ſupplies and perfects the reſt; but in <hi>Sciences,</hi> the firſt Author goeth fartheſt, and time looſeth and corrupteth. So we ſee <hi>Artillery, Saileing, Printing,</hi> were imperfect, formeleſſe, and groſſely managed at firſt, but in progreſſe of time accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and refined. But contrariwiſe the <hi>Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Sciences</hi> of <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Democritus, Hypocrates, Euclide, Archimede,</hi> were of moſt vigor in their Auctors, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, became rather degenerate and embaſed, and loſt much of their luſtre; whereof the reaſon is no other, but that in <hi>Arts Mechanicall, many wits and induſtries have contributed in one, in liberall Arts and Sciences, many wits and induſtries have bin ſpent about, and yeelded to the art of ſome one;</hi> whom (notwithſtanding many times) his ſectators have rather depraved than illuſtrated. <hi>For as water</hi> will not aſcend higher then the levell of the firſt ſpring-head, from whence it deſcendeth, ſo knowledge derived from <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> will never riſe higher than the knowledge of Ariſtotle.<note place="margin">Ariſt. de Rep.

               <p n="1">I The firſt of theſe is an <hi>extreme affection of two extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Antiquity and Novelty;</hi> wherein the daughters of <hi>Time,</hi> doe take after the Father; for as Time devoureth his children, ſo theſe, one of them ſeeketh to depreſſe the other; while <hi>Antiquity</hi> envieth there ſhould be <hi>new Additions;</hi> and <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> can not be content to adde things <hi>recent,</hi> but it muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face and reject the <hi>old.</hi> Surely the advice of the Prophet is the true direction in this caſe,<note place="margin">Ierem. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtate ſuper vias antiquas &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dete quaenam fit via recta &amp; bona &amp; ambulate in ea: Antiquity</hi> deſerveth that reverence, that men ſhould make a ſtay a while, and ſtand thereupon, and look about to diſcover which is the beſt way; but when the diſcovery is well ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:150781:79"/> than not to reſt there, but cheerefully to make progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Indeed to ſpeak truly, <hi>Antiquitas ſeculi, Juventus Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi> Certainly our times are the Ancient times, when the world is now Ancient, and not thoſe which we count An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, <hi>ordine retrogrado,</hi> by a computation backward from our own times.</p>
               <p n="2">II An other error induced by the former is, <hi>a ſuſpition and diffidence, that any thing ſhould be now to be found out, which the world ſhould have miſt and paſt over ſo long time:</hi> as if the ſame objection might be made to <hi>Time,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sen. ait Lact. Inſt. Lib. 1.</note> wherewith <hi>Lucian</hi> reproacheth <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and other the Heathen Gods, <hi>For he wonders that they begot ſo many children in old time, and begot none in his time?</hi> and askes in ſcoffing manner, <hi>whether they were now become Septuagenary, or whether the Law Papia; made againſt old mens mariages, had reſtrained them?</hi> So it ſeemes men doubt leaſt time is become paſt children and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nay rather the levity and inconſtancy of mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is hence plainly diſcovered, which untill a matter be done, wonder it can be done. So <hi>Alexander's</hi> expedition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aſia</hi> was prejudg'd as a vaſt and impoſsible enterprize; yet afterwards it pleaſed <hi>Livie,</hi> ſo to ſlight it as to ſay of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hiſt. lib. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Nil aliud quam bene auſus eſt vana contemnere:</hi> The ſame hapned unto <hi>Columbus</hi> in the weſterne Navigation. But in intellectuall matters it is much more common, as may be ſeen in many propoſitions in <hi>Euclide,</hi> which till they be demonſtrate, they ſeem ſtrange to our aſſent; but being Demonſtrate, our minde accepteth of them by a kind of Recogniſance or Retractation, (as the Lawyers ſpeak) as if we had underſtood and knowne them before.</p>
               <p n="3">III An other error which hath ſome affinity with the former is, <hi>a conceit That all ſects and ancient opinions, after they have bin diſcuſſed and ventilated; the beſt ſtill prevail'd and ſuppreſt the reſt.</hi> Wherefore they think that if a man ſhould begin the labour of a new ſearch and examination, he muſt needs light upon ſomewhat formerly rejected, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, loſt, and brought into oblivion: as if the <hi>multitude,</hi> or the wiſeſt, to gratify the <hi>multitude,</hi> were not more ready
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:150781:79"/> to give paſſage to that which is populare and ſuperficiall; than to that which is ſubſtantiall and profound. <hi>For Time</hi> ſeemeth to be of the nature of a River, which carrieth down to us that which is light and blown up, and ſinketh and drowneth that which is waighty and ſolid.</p>
               <p n="1">I Another error of divers nature from the former is, <hi>The overearly and Peremptory reduction of Knowledge into Arts and Methods; which once done, commonly ſciences receive ſmall or no augmentation.</hi> For as young men, when they knit and ſhape perfectly, doe ſeldome grow to a farther ſtature: ſo knowledge while it is diſperſt into <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> and <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,</hi> may grow and ſhoot up; but once incloſed and comprehended in Methods, it may perchance be farther poliſht and illuſtrate, and accommodated for uſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, but it increaſeth no more in bulke and ſubſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">V Another error which doth ſucceed that which we laſt noted, is, <hi>That after diſtribution of Particular Arts and Sciences into their ſeverall places, many men have preſently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned the univerſall notion of things, or</hi> Philoſophia Prima, <hi>which is a deadly enemy to all Progreſsion.</hi> Proſpects are made from Turrets and high places; and it is impoſsible to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the more remote and deeper parts of any ſcience, if you ſtand but upon the flat and levell of the ſame ſcience, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend not as into a watch-Tower to a higher ſcience.</p>
               <p n="6">VI Another error hath proceeded <hi>from too great a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and a kind of Adoration of the mind and underſtanding of man, by means whereof men have withdrawn themſelves, too much, from the contemplation of Nature, and the obſervations of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and have tumbled up and downe in their own ſpeculations and conceits;</hi> but of theſe ſurpaſsing <hi>Opinators,</hi> and (if J may ſo ſpeak) <hi>Jntellectualiſts,</hi> (which are notwithſtanding, taken for the moſt ſublime &amp; divine Philoſophers) <hi>Heraclitus</hi> gave a juſt cenſure, ſaying, <hi>Men ſeek truth in their own litle world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">N. L.</note> 
                  <hi>and not in the great common world,</hi> for they diſdaine the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet of nature, and <hi>Primer-Book</hi> of the Divine works; which if they did not, they might perchance by degrees and leaſure, after the knowledge of ſimple letters, and ſpelling
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:150781:80"/> of Syllables, come at laſt, to read perfectly the Text and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of the Creatures. But they, contrariwiſe, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meditation and agitation of wit, urge, and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate their own ſpirits to divine and give <hi>Oracles</hi> unto them, whereby they are deſervedly and pleaſingly deluded.</p>
               <p n="7">VII Another Error that hath ſome connexion with this latter, is, <hi>That men doe oftentimes imbue and infect their meditations and doctrines with the infuſions of ſome Opinions, and conceptions of their own, which they have moſt admired; or ſome ſciences to which they have moſt applied and conſecrated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, giving all things a Dye and Tincture, though very decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, from theſe favorite ſtudies.</hi> So hath <hi>Plato</hi> intermingled his Philoſophy with Theology; <hi>Aristotle</hi> with Logique; The ſecond Schoole of <hi>Plato, Proclus</hi> and the reſt, with the Mathematiques. Theſe Arts had a kind of <hi>Primo-geniture</hi> with them, which they would ſtill be kiſsing and making much of, as their firſt borne ſonnes. But the <hi>Alchimiſts</hi> have forged a new Philoſophy out of the Fire and Furnace; and <hi>Gilbert</hi> our Countrey-man, hath extracted another Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy out of a Load-ſtone. So <hi>Cicero,</hi> when reciting the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinions of the nature of the ſoule, he found a Muſitian that held the ſoule was but a harmony, ſaith pleſantly, <hi>Hic ab arte ſua non receſsit:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tuſc. lib. 1.</note> But of theſe errors <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith aptly and wiſely,<note place="margin">De Gen. &amp; Cor. lib. 1. &amp; alibi.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui reſpiciunt ad pauca de facili pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">VIII Another error is, <hi>An impatience of Doubt, and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed haſt to Aſſertion without due and mature ſuſpenſion of the judgement:</hi> For the two waies of contemplation are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like the two waies of Action, commonly ſpoken of by the Ancients; of which the one was a plaine and ſmooth way in the beginning, but in the end impaſsible; the other rough and troubleſome in the entrance, but after a while faire and even; ſo is it in contemplations, if a man will begin in certainties, he ſhall end in doubts; but if he can be content to begin with doubts, and have patience a while, he ſhall end in certainties.</p>
               <p n="9">IX The like error diſcovereth it ſelfe in the <hi>manner of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:150781:80"/> Tradition and Delivery of knowledge, which is, for the moſt part, imperious and magiſtrall, not ingenious and faithfull; ſo contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as may rather command our aſſent, than ſtand to examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It is true that in compendious Treatiſes deſigned for Practice, that Forme of writing may be retained; but in a juſt and compleat handling of knowledge, both extremes are to be avoided,<note place="margin">Cic. de Nat. Dier. lib. 1.</note> as well the veine of <hi>Velleius</hi> the Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, <hi>who feard nothing ſo much as to ſeem to doubt of any thing;</hi> as that of <hi>Socrates</hi> and the Academie, leaving all things in doubt and incertainty: Rather men ſhould affect candor and ſincerity, propounding things with more or leſſe aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration, as they ſtand in their judgement proved, more or leſſe.</p>
               <p n="10">X Other errors there are <hi>in the ſcope that men propound to themſelves whereunto they bend their endeavours and ſtudies:</hi> For whereas the moſt devout Leaders and noted Profeſſors of Learning, ought chiefly to propound to themſelves to make ſome notable addition to the ſcience they profeſſe; contrariwiſe, they convert their labours to aſpire to certain ſecond prizes, as to be a <hi>profound interpreter,</hi> or commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; a ſharp and ſtrong champion or <hi>Defendor;</hi> a Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call compounder or <hi>Abridger:</hi> ſo the Revenewes and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Sciences come to be improved, but not the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Inheritance.</p>
               <p n="11">XI But the greateſt error of all the reſt is, <hi>the miſtaking or miſplacing the last and farthest end of knowledge:</hi> For many have entred into a deſire of Learning and Knowledge, ſome upon an imbred and reſtleſſe <hi>Curioſity;</hi> others to entertaine their mindes with variety and <hi>delight;</hi> others for <hi>ornament and reputation;</hi> others for <hi>contradiction</hi> and victory in diſpute; others for <hi>Lucre</hi> and living; few to improve the gift of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given them from God, to the benefite and uſe of men. As if there were ſought in knowledge, a <hi>couch,</hi> whereupon to reſt a reſtleſſe and ſearching ſpirit, or a <hi>Tarraſſe</hi> for a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and variable mind to walk up and downe in at liberty unreſtrained; or ſome high and eminent <hi>Tower of State,</hi> from which a proud and ambitious mind, may haue a Proſpect;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:150781:81"/> or a <hi>Fort</hi> and commanding ground for ſtrife and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or a <hi>ſhop</hi> for profit and ſale; and not rather a <hi>rich ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe and Armorie</hi> for the glory of the Creator of all things, and the reliefe of mans eſtate. For this is that which indeed would dignify and exalt Learning; if contemplation and Action were more neerely and ſtraitly, than hitherto they have bin conjoyn'd and united together: which combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, certainly would be like unto that conjunction of the two higheſt Planets, when Saturne which hath the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over reſt and contemplations, conſpires with <hi>Iupiter</hi> the Lord of Civill ſociety and Action. Howbeit J doe not mean when I ſpeak of uſe and Action, Profeſſory or Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Learning, for I am not ignorant how much that diverts and interrupteth the <hi>Progreſsion and advancement of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> like indeed the <hi>Golden apple,</hi> thrown before <hi>Atalanta,</hi> which while ſhe goes aſide and ſtoopeth to take up, the race is hindred,<note place="margin">Ovid. Met. 10.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Neither is it my meaning, as was ſpoken of <hi>Socrates,</hi> to call Philoſophy down from heaven, to converſe upon the earth; that is to lay <hi>Naturall Philoſophy</hi> aſide, and to celebrate only <hi>Morall Philoſophy</hi> and <hi>Policy.</hi> But as Heaven and Earth doe conſpire and contribute, to the uſe and benefit of the life of Man; ſo indeed this ſhould be the end of <hi>both Philoſophies;</hi> that vain ſpeculations, and what ever is empty and barren, being rejected; that which is ſolid and fruitfull may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and augmented; that ſo Knowledge, may not be a Courtezane for Pleaſure, or as a bond-woman for gaine; but as a ſpouſe for generation, fruit and honeſt ſolace.</p>
               <p>§ Now me thinks I have deſcribed and opened, as by a kind of Diſſection, thoſe <hi>Peccant Humors;</hi> or at leaſt, the Principall of them, <hi>which have not only given impediment to the Proficience of Learning, but have given alſo occaſion to the traducement thereof.</hi> Wherein if I have come too neere the quick,<note place="margin">Pſal. 141.</note> it muſt be remembred, <hi>Fidelia vulnera a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantis, doloſa oſcula malignantis:</hi> however this ſurely I think I have gain'd, that I ought to be the better believed, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Commendations of Learning</hi> in that which followes,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:150781:81"/> becauſe I have proceeded ſo freely concerning cenſure, in that which went before. And yet J have no purpoſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a <hi>Laudative of Learning,</hi> or to make a <hi>Hymne to the Muſes;</hi> though I am of opinion, that it is long ſince their Rites were duely celebrated: but my intent is, without var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh or amplification, to take the juſt waight and to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the <hi>Dignity of Knowledge</hi> in the ſcales with other things; and to ſearch out the true valewes thereof, <hi>from te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies Divine and Humane.</hi>

Wherein we may not ſeeke it by the name of <hi>Learning;</hi> for all <hi>Learning</hi> is Knowledge acquired, and no knowledge in God is <hi>acquired,</hi> but <hi>Originall:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt look for it by another name, that is <hi>wiſdome</hi> or <hi>ſapience,</hi> as the ſacred Scriptures call it. It is ſo than; In the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Creation,</hi> we ſee a double emanation of Divine virtue from God; whereof the one is referr'd to <hi>Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> that is chiefly expreſt in making the <hi>Maſſe</hi> and ſubſtance of the <hi>Matter;</hi> this in diſpoſing the beauty of the <hi>Forme.</hi> This being ſuppoſed it is to be obſerved, that for any thing which appeares in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Creation,</hi> the confuſed Maſſe and Matter of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> was made in a moment of Time; yet the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:150781:82"/> of that <hi>Chaos</hi> or Maſſe, was the work of ſix daies: ſuch a note of difference it pleaſed God to put upon the workes of <hi>Power,</hi> and the works of <hi>Wiſdome;</hi> wherewith concurres, that in the Creation of the <hi>Matter;</hi> It is not recorded that God ſaid <hi>Let there be Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> as it is ſaid of the works following; but ſimply and actually, <hi>God made Heaven and Earth:</hi> ſo that the <hi>Matter</hi> ſeemes to be as a <hi>Manufacture,</hi> but the <hi>Forme</hi> carries the ſtile of a <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Decree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Let us proceed <hi>from God to Angels or Spirits,</hi> whoſe nature in order of Dignity is next Gods. We ſee, ſo farre as credit is to be given to the Celeſtiall Hierarchy, ſet forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Dionyſius Areopagita,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dion.

So as from this order and diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it appeares, that <hi>the Angels of Knowledge and Illumination, are placed before the Angels of Office and Domination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ To deſcend from Spirits and Intellectuall Formes, to Senſible and Materiall Formes; we read <hi>that the firſt of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted formes was Light;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> which hath a relation and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in nature and Corporall things, to knowledge in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Jncorporall things.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note>§ After the Creation was finiſht, we read that <hi>Man was plact in the Garden to worke therein;</hi> which work ſo appointed to him, could be no other than the <hi>work of Contemplation,</hi> that is, the end hereof was not for neceſsity, but for delight and exerciſe without vexation or trouble: For there being than no reluctation of the Creature, no ſweat of the brow; mans imployment muſt of conſequence have bin matter of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>contemplation, not of Labour and Worke.</hi> Againe, the firſt Acts that man perform'd in <hi>Paradice,</hi> comprehended the two ſummary parts of <hi>knowledge;</hi> thoſe were the <hi>view of

               <p>§ To paſſe to the firſt event or occurrence after the Fall of Man, we ſee (as the Scriptures have infinite Myſteries, not violating at all the truth of the ſtory or letter) <hi>an image of the two States, the Contemplative and Active,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>figur'd in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Abel and Cain,</hi> and in their Profeſsions and Primitive trades of life; whereof the one was a Sheapheard, who by reaſon of his leaſure, reſt in a place, and free view of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>is a lively image of a Contemplative life;</hi> the other a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, that is, a man toild and tired with working; and his countenance fixt upon the earth; <hi>where we may ſee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Election of God went to the Sheapheard and not to the tiller of Ground.</hi>

               <p>§ In the next Age after the flood,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> the great judgements of God upon the ambition of Man was the <hi>Confuſion of Tongues, whereby the open trade and intercourſe of Learning and Knowledge was chiefly embraced.</hi>

                  <hi>The Glory of God is to conceale a thing, but the Glory of a King is to find it out:</hi> As if according to that innocent and affectionate play of Children, the Divine Majeſty took delight to hide his works, to the end to have them found out; and as if <hi>Kings</hi> could not obtain a greater Honour, then to be Gods play-fellowes in that game; ſpecially conſidering the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they have of wits and means, whereby the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things may be perfected.</p>
               <p>§ Neither did the diſpenſation of God varie in the times after our Saviour came into the world, <hi>For our Saviour himſelfe did first ſhew his power to ſubdue Jgnorance, by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the Doctors of the Law,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ So in the election of <hi>thoſe inſtruments which it pleaſed God to uſe in the Plantation of the Faith,</hi> at the firſt he imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons altogether Unlearned, otherwiſe than by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the holy Spirit; whereby more evidently he might declare his immediat and divine working, and might abaſe all humane Wiſdome and Knowledge: Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that counſill of his in this reſpect was no ſooner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, but in the next viciſsitude and ſucceſsion of time he ſent his divine Truth into the world, waited on with other Learning, as with ſervants and hand-maids; therefore we ſee <hi>S.

               <p>§ So again we know, <hi>that many of the Ancient Biſhops and Doctors of the Church were excellently read and ſtudied in all the Learning of the Heathen;</hi> in ſo much that the Edict of the <hi>Emperour Iulian,</hi>

                  <hi>whereby it was interdicted unto Chriſtians to be admitted into Schooles, or exerciſes of Learning,</hi> was eſtimed and accounted a more pernitious Engine and Machination againſt the Chriſtian Faith, than were all the ſanguinary proſequtions of his predeceſſors.<note place="margin">P.

But contrariwiſe it was the Chriſtian Church, which amidſt the inundations of the Scythians from the North-weſt; and the Saracens from the Eaſt, did preſerve in the ſacred Lap and Boſome thereof the <hi>pretious reliques of Heathen Learning,</hi> which otherwiſe had utterly periſht and bin extinguiſht.

               <p>§ Wherefore to conclude this Part, there are two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Duties &amp; Services beſides ornament and illuſtration, which human Learning doth performe to Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>The one, becauſe they are effectuall incitements to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and celebration of the Glory of God:</hi> for as the Pſalmes,<note place="margin">Pſal.

               <p n="1">I. Firſt therefore in the degrees of Honor amongſt the Heathens, it was the higheſt, to attain to a Veneration and Adoration as a God; this indeed to the Chriſtians is as the forbidden fruit; but we ſpeak now ſeparately of Humane Teſtimony. Therefore, (as we were ſaying) with the Heathens, that which the Grecians call <hi>Apotheoſis;</hi> and the Latines <hi>Relatio inter Divos;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Herodia. l. 4 Dio. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui.</note> was the ſupreme Honour which man could attribute unto Man: ſpecially, when it was given, not by a formall Decree or Act of Eſtate, (as it was uſed amongſt the Roman Emperors,) but freely by the aſſent of Men and inward beliefe. Of which high Honour there was a certain degree and midle terme: For there were reckoned above <hi>Humane Honours, Honours Heroicall;</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> in the Diſtribution whereof, Antiquity obſerved this order. Founders of States; Lawgivers; Extirpers of Tyrants; Fathers of their Country, and other eminent Perſons in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Merit, were honour'd with the title of <hi>Worthies</hi> only, or <hi>Demi-Gods;</hi> ſuch as were <hi>Theſeus, Minos, Romulus,</hi> and the like: on the other ſide ſuch as were <hi>Inventors and Authors of new Arts; and ſuch as endowed mans life with new Commodities, and acceſsions were ever conſecrated among the Greater and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:150781:85"/> Gods;</hi> which hapned to <hi>Ceres, Bacchus, Mercury, Apollo,</hi> and others, which indeed was done juſtly and upon ſound judgement: For the <hi>merits of the former,</hi> are commonly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within the circle of an Age, or a Nation, and are not unlike ſeaſonable and favoring ſhowers, which though they be profitable and deſirable, yet ſerve but for that ſeaſon only wherein they fall, and for a Latitude of ground which they water: <hi>but the benefices of the latter,</hi> like the influences of the Sunne, and the heavenly bodies, are for time, perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, for place, univerſall: thoſe again are commonly mixt with ſtrife and perturbation; but theſe have the true chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Divine preſence, and come in <hi>Aura leni</hi> without noiſe or agitation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Neither certainly is the <hi>Merit of Learning in Civile affaires, and in repreſsing the inconveniences which grow from man to man, much inferior to the other which relieve mans neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, which ariſe from Nature.</hi> And this kind of merit was lively ſet forth in that fained relation of <hi>Orpheus Theatre,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philoſt. in Orph.</note> where all beaſts and birds aſſembled, which forgetting their proper naturall appetites of Prey, of Game, of Quarrell, ſtood all ſociably and lovingly together, liſtning unto the Aires and accords of the harpe; the ſound whereof no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ceaſed; or was drown'd by ſome lowder noiſe, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beaſt returned to his own nature. In which Fable is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribed, the nature and condition of men, who are toſſed and diſordered with ſundry ſavage and unreclaim'd deſires, of Profit, of Luſt, of Revenge; which yet as long as they give eare to precepts, to the perſwaſion of Religion, Lawes, and Magiſtrates, eloquently and ſweetly coucht in Bookes, to Sermons and Haranges, ſo long is ſociety and peace maintaind; but if theſe inſtruments be ſilent, or that ſeditions and tumults make them not audible, all things diſſolve and fall back into Anarchy and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>§ But this appeareth more manifeſtly, <hi>when Kings or Perſons of Authority under them, or other Governors in States, are endowed with Learning:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plato de Rep. 5.</note> For although he might be thought partiall to his own profeſsion that ſaid <hi>Than ſhould People or
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150781:86"/> States be happy when either Kings were Philoſophers or Philoſophers Kings;</hi> yet ſo much is verified by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>that under wiſe and Learned Princes and Governors of State, there hath bin ever the beſt and happieſt times.</hi> For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Kings may have their errors and imperfections; that is, be liable to Paſsions and depraved cuſtomes, like other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet if they be illuminated by Learning, they have certain anticipate notions of Religion, Policy, and Morality, which preſerve and refrain them from all ruinous and peremptory errors and exceſſes, whiſpering evermore in their eares, when Councellors, and Servants ſtand mute and ſilent. So likewiſe <hi>Senators and Councellors which be Learned, doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon more ſafe and ſubſtantiall principles, than Councellors which are only men of experience:</hi> Thoſe ſeeing dangers a farre off, and repulſing them betimes; whereas theſe are wiſe only neere at hand, ſeeing nothing, but what is imminent and ready to fall upon them, and than truſt to the agility of their wit, in the point of dangers, to ward and avoid them.</p>
               <p>§ Which felicity of times under <hi>Learned Princes</hi> (to keep ſtill the law of brevity by uſing the moſt ſelected and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent examples) doth beſt appear, in the Age which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the death of <hi>Domitianus</hi> the Emperor, untill the raigne of <hi>Commodus, comprehending a ſucceſsion of ſixe Princes, all Learned, or ſingular favourers and advancers of Learning, and of all ages (if we regard temporall happineſſe) the most floriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ever Rome ſaw, which was then the Modell and Epitome of the world:</hi> A matter revealed and prefigur'd unto <hi>Domitian</hi> in a dream,<note place="margin">Suet. in Dom parag 23.</note> the night before he was ſlaine, <hi>for he ſeem'd to ſee grown behind upon his ſhoulders a neck and a head of gold;</hi> which Divination came indeed accordingly to paſſe, in thoſe golden times which ſucceeded; of which we will make ſome particular, but brief commemoration. <hi>Nerva</hi> was a Learned Prince, an inward acquaintance, and even a Diſciple to <hi>Apollonius</hi> the Pythagorean; who alſo almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in a verſe of Homers,

                  <hi>Trajan</hi> was for his Perſon not Learned, but an admirer of

               <p>§ As for <hi>Iulius Caeſar the excellency of his Learning,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cic. de cla. Orat. Cic. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. l. 3. Suet. in Iul.</note> needs not to be argued, either from his education, or his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or his anſwers; For this, in a high degree, doth declare it ſelfe in his own writings, and works, whereof ſome are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſome unfortunately periſh't. For firſt, there is left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us <hi>that excellent Hiſtory of his own warres, which he entitled only a</hi> COMMENTARY;<note place="margin">Suet. in parag. 56.</note> wherein all ſucceeding times have admired the ſolid waight of matter; and lively images of Actions and Perſons, expreſt in the greateſt propriety of words, and perſpicuity of Narration, that ever was. Which endowments, that they were not infuſed by nature, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by <hi>Precepts and inſtructions of Learning,</hi> is well wit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſſed by that work of his entitled DE ANALOGIA,<note place="margin">Parag. 56.</note> which was nothing elſe but a <hi>Grammaticall Philoſophy,</hi> wherein he did labour, to make this, <hi>vox ad Placitum,</hi> to become <hi>vox ad Licitum,</hi> and to reduce cuſtome of ſpeech, to congruity of ſpeech; that words, which are the images of things, might accord with the things themſelves, and not ſtand to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement of the vulgar. So likewiſe we have by his edict, <hi>a reformed computation of the year,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suet. in parag. 48.</note> correſpondent to the courſe of the Sunne; which evidently ſhewes, that he accounted it his equall glory, to finde out the lawes, of the ſtarres in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as to give lawes to men on earth. So in that Book of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150781:89"/> his entitled ANTI-CATO;<note place="margin">Plut. in Caeſar.</note> it doth eaſily appear, that he did aſpire, as well to victory of wit, as victory of warre; underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therein a Conflict againſt the greateſt Champion with the Penne, that then lived, <hi>Cicero the Oratour.</hi> Againe in his Book of APOPHTHEGMES, which he collected, we ſee he eſtimed it more honour, to make himſelfe but a paire of Tables, or Codicills, wherein to regiſter the wiſe and grave ſayings of others; then if his own words were hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed as Oracles, as many vain Princes by cuſtome of Flattery, delight to doe. But if I ſhould report diverſe of his <hi>Speeches,</hi> as I did in <hi>Alexander,</hi> they are truly ſuch, as Salomon notes,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.</note>

For firſt it pretended a refuſall of the name, but yet not ſerious: again, it did carry with it an infinite confidence, and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:150781:89"/> as if the Appellation <hi>Caeſar.</hi> had bin a more eminent Title, than the name of King; which hath come to paſſe, and remaineth ſo till this day. But, that which moſt made for him, this ſpeech by an excellent contrivance, advanced his own purpoſe; for it did cloſely inſinuate, that the Senate and People of Rome, did ſtrive with him about a vaine ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, a name only, (for he had the power of a King already) and for ſuch a name, whereof mean families were inveſted; for the Sur-name <hi>Rex,</hi> was the title of many families; as we alſo have the like in our Dialect. The laſt ſpeech, which I will mention in this place, was this; When <hi>Caeſar,</hi> after the warre was declared, did poſſeſſe himſelfe of the City of Rome, and had broke open the inner <hi>Treaſury,</hi> to take the mony there ſtored up, for the ſervice of the warre, <hi>Metellus,</hi> for that time Tribune, withſtood him; to whom <hi>Caeſar,</hi>

                  <hi>If thou doſt perſiſt,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thou art dead;</hi> preſently taking himſelfe up, he added, <hi>Young man, it is harder for me to ſpeak this, than to doe it; Adoleſcens, durius eſt mihi hoc dicere quam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cëre;</hi> A ſpeech compounded of the greateſt terror, and the greateſt clemency, that could proceed out of the mouth of man. But, to purſue <hi>Caeſars</hi> Abilities in this kind no farther, it is evident, that he knew well <hi>his own perfection in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as appears, when ſome ſpake, what a ſtrange reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it was in <hi>Lucius Scylla</hi> to reſigne his <hi>Dictature;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Suet. in Iul. §. 77.</note> he ſcoffing at him, anſwered, <hi>That Scylla could not skill of Letters, and therefore knew not how to Dictate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Now it were time to leave this point touching <hi>the ſtrict concurrence of Military virtue and Learning,</hi> (for what example in this kind, can come with any grace, after <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and <hi>Caeſar?</hi>) were it not that J am tranſported with the height and rareneſſe of one other particular inſtance, as that which did ſo ſuddenly paſſe from ſcorne to wonder; and it is of <hi>Xenophon the Philoſopher,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Xen. Hiſt. de Exp.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150781:90"/> the warre as a voluntary, for the love and converſation of <hi>Proxenus</hi> his friend. He was by chance preſent when <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> came in meſſage from the great King, to the Grecians, after that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was ſlain in the field, and the Grecians, a handfull of men, having loſt their Generall, left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the midſt of the Provinces of Perſia, cut off from their Country by the interception of many miles, and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and deep rivers. The Meſſage did import that they ſhould deliver up their Armes, and ſubmit themſelves to the Kings mercy: to which meſſage before publique anſwer was made, diverſe of the Army, conferr'd familiarly with <hi>Falinus,</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Xenophon</hi> hapned to ſay thus, <hi>why,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>Falinus we have now but theſe two things left,</hi>

Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over Beaſts and Cattle, ſuch as Heardmen and Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards have, is a thing contemptible; Commandment over children, ſuch as School-maſters and Tutors have, is a matter of ſmall honour; commandment over ſlaves, is a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rather then an honour; neither is the commandment of Tyrants much better, over a ſervile People, diſmantled of their Spirits and generoſity of mind; therefore it was ever helde that honours in free Monarchies and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths had a ſweetneſſe more than in Tyrannies; becauſe a command over the willing is more honourable than over the forced and compelled: Wherefore <hi>

                  <hi>But the Commandment of knowledge is farre higher than the Commandment over the will, though free, and not enſlaved and vaſſal'd: For it is a Dominion over Reaſon, Beliefe, and the Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, which is the higheſt part of man, and gives Law to the will it ſelfe:</hi> For without Queſtion there is no power on
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:150781:92"/> earth, which advanceth and ſets up a Throne, and, as it were, <hi>a Chaire of eſtate,</hi> in the ſoules of men and their Cogitations, Aſſents, and Beliefe, <hi>but Knowledge and Learning:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſee, the deteſtable and extreme pleaſure that <hi>Arch-Heretiques, falſe Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Impoſtors</hi> are raviſh't, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported withall, when once they find that they begin to have a Dominion, and Superiority over the faith and conſciences of men; indeed ſo great, as hee that hath once taſted it, it is ſeldome ſeen that any perſecution or torture can make them relinquiſh this Soveraignty: But as this is that which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Auctor of the Revelation calls,<note place="margin">Apoc. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>The depth or profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Satan;</hi> ſo on the contrary, the juſt and lawfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over mens minds, eſtabliſh't by the cleer evidence, and ſweet commendation of Truth, approacheth certainly neereſt to the ſimilitude of the Divine Rule.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for Fortunes and Honours, the munificence of Learning doth not ſo enrich and adorne whole Kingdomes and Common-wealths, as it doth not likewiſe amplifie and advance the Fortunes and Eſtates of particular perſons:</hi> For it is an ancient obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Homer hath given more men their living, than either Sylla or Caeſar, or Augustus ever did,</hi> notwithſtanding their great Largeſſes, ſuch infinite donatives, and diſtributions of ſo much land. No doubt, it is hard to ſay, whether Armes or Learning have advanced greater numbers: But if wee ſpeake of Soveraignty, we ſee, <hi>that if Armes have carried away the Kingdome, yet Learning hath borne away the Prieſthood,</hi> which ever hath bin in ſome competition with Empire.</p>
               <p>§ Againe, <hi>Jf you contemplate the Pleaſure and Delight of Knowledge and Learning, aſſuredly it farre ſurpaſſes all other pleaſure:</hi> For what? Shall, perchance, the pleaſures of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſo farre excell the pleaſures of the ſences, as a happy obtaining of a deſire, doth a ſong or a dinner; and muſt not by the ſame degrees of conſequence, the pleaſure of the Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect tranſcend thoſe of the Affections? In all other plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures there is a finite ſatiety, and after they grow a litle ſtale, their flower and verdure vades and departs; whereby we are inſtructed, that they were not indeed pure and ſincere
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:150781:92"/> pleaſures, but ſhadowes and deceits of <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> and that it was the Novelty which pleas'd, and not the Quality: therefore voluptuous men often turne Friers, and the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning age of ambitious Princes is commonly more ſad and beſieged with Melancholy; <hi>But of Knowledge there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety;</hi> but viciſsitude, perpetually and interchangeably, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning of fruition and appetite; ſo that the good of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light muſt needs be ſimple, without Accident or Fallacy. Neither is that <hi>Pleaſure</hi> of ſmall efficacy and contentment in the mind of man, which the Poet <hi>Lucretius</hi> deſcribeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly, <hi>Swave, mari magno turbantibus aequora ventis, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Rer. Nat. lib. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>It is a view of delight</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſtand or walke upon the ſhore, and to ſee a ſhip toſt with tempest upon the ſea: à pleaſure, to stand in the window of a Caſtle, and to ſee two Battailes joyne upon a plaine: but it is a pleaſure incomparable, for the mind of man, by Learning to be ſetled and fortified in the Tower of Truth, and from thence to behold the errors and wandrings of other men below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Laſtly leaving the vulgar arguments, <hi>that by Learning man excels man: in that wherein man excels beaſts;</hi> that by the help of Learning, man aſcends in his underſtanding, even to the heavens, whether in body he can not come, and the like; let us conclude this diſcourſe concerning the <hi>dignity of knowledge and Learning,</hi> with that good, whereunto mans nature doth moſt aſpire, <hi>Immortality and continuance.</hi> For to this tendeth generation, raiſing of houſes and Families, Buildings, Foundations, Monuments, Fame, and in effect the ſumme and height of humane deſires. <hi>But we ſee how farre the monuments of wit and Learning, are more durable than the Monuments of materiate Memorialls and Manu-factures.</hi> Have not the <hi>verſes of Homer</hi> continued xxv Centuries of years and above, without the loſſe of a ſyllable, or letter? during which time, infinite number of Places, Temples, Caſtles, Citties, have bin decayed or bin demoliſh't. The <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Cyrus, Alexander, Caeſar,</hi> no nor of the Kings and Princes of much later years, by no means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible are now recoverable; for the Originals worne away with age, are periſh't; and the Copies daily looſe of the life
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:150781:93"/> and Primitive reſemblance; <hi>But the images of mens wits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unmaimed in books for ever, exempt from the injuries of time, becauſe capable of perpetuall renovation.</hi> Neither can they properly be called Images, becauſe, in their way, they generate ſtill and caſt their ſeeds in the mindes of men; raiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and procreating infinite Actions and Opinions in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages. So that if the invention of a ſhip, was thought ſo noble and wonderfull, which tranſports Riches and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandice from Place to Place; and conſociats the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote regions in participation of their fruits and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; <hi>how much more are letters to be magnified, which as ſhips, paſsing through the vaſt ſea of time, counite the remoteſt ages of Wits and Inventions in mutuall Trafique and Correſpondency?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Furthermore, we ſee ſome of the Philoſophers which were moſt immerſed in the ſenſes and leaſt divine, and which peremptorily denied the immortality of the ſoule, yet convicted by the power of truth came to this point, <hi>That whatſoever Motions and Acts is the ſpirit of man could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme without the Organ of the body, it was probable that thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained after death;</hi> ſuch as were the motions of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but not of the affections; <hi>ſo immortall and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible a thing did knowledge ſeem to them to be.</hi> But we, illuminated with divine Revelation, diſclaiming theſe rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and deluſions of the ſenſes, know that not only the mind, but the affections purified; not only the ſoule, but the body ſhall be advanced in its time to immortality. But it muſt be remembred, both now and at other times, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the point may require, that in the proofes, of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Knowledge and Learning, J did at the beginning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Divine Teſtimonies from Humane; which method I have conſtantly purſued and ſo handled them both apart. Although all this be true, nevertheleſſe I doe not take upon me, neither can I hope to obtaine by any Perorations, or pleadings of this caſe touching Learning, to reverſe the judgement either of <hi>Aeſops Cock, that preferred the Barly-corne before the Gemme;</hi>

Q. ELIZABETH was a ſojourner in the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150781:95"/> world, in reſpect of her unmarried life, rather than an inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant: ſhe hath indeed adorned her own time, and many waies enricht it; but in truth, to Your Majeſty, whom God hath bleſt with ſo much Royall Iſſue worthy to perpetuate you for ever; whoſe youthfull and fruitfull Bed, doth yet promiſe more children; it is very proper, not only to irradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, as you doe, your own times, but alſo to extend your Cares to thoſe Acts which ſucceeding Ages may cheriſh, and Eternity it ſelfe behold: Amongſt which, if my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Learning doe not tranſport me, there is none more worthy, or more noble, <hi>than the endowment of the world with ſound and fruitfull Advancements of Learning:</hi> For why ſhould we erect unto ourſelves ſome few Authors, to ſtand like <hi>Hercules Columnes,</hi> beyond which there ſhould be no diſcovery of knowledge; ſeeing we have <hi>your Majeſty,</hi> as a bright and benigne ſtarre, to conduct and proſper us in this Navigation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To returne therefore unto our purpoſe, let us now waigh and conſider with our ſelves, what hitherto hath bin performed, what pretermitted by Princes and others, for the <hi>Propagation of Learning:</hi> And this we will purſue cloſely and diſtinctly, in an Active and Maſculine Expreſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no where digreſsing, nothing dilateing. Let this ground therefore be laid, which every one may grant, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt difficult works are overcome, either by the <hi>Amplitude of Reward,</hi> or by the <hi>wiſdome and ſoundneſſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> or by <hi>conjunction of Labours;</hi> whereof the firſt, <hi>encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth our endeavours;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>takes away Error and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion;</hi> the third, <hi>ſupplies the frailty of Man.</hi> But the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall amongſt theſe three, is the <hi>wiſdome and ſoundneſſe of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> that is, a Delincation and Demonſtration of a right and eaſy way to accompliſh any enterprize. <hi>Claudus enim,</hi> as the ſaying is, <hi>in via antevertit Curſorem extra viam;</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> aptly to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.</note>

            </p>
            <p n="2">II.

            <p>§ Furthermore, the works pertaining to the <hi>Perſons of Learned men,</hi> beſides the <hi>Advancing and Countenancing of them</hi> in generall, are likewiſe two; the <hi>Remuneration</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of Readers,</hi> in <hi>Arts and Sciences already extant</hi> and known; and the <hi>Remuneration and Deſignation of writers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe parts of Knowledge, which hetherto have not bin ſufficiently till'd and labour'd.</hi> Theſe breefely are the works and Acts, wherein the Merit of many renowned Princes and other illuſtrious Perſons, hath bin famed, <hi>towards the ſtate of Learning.</hi> As for particular Commemoration, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that hath well deſerved of Learning, when I think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that of <hi>Cicero</hi> comes into my mind, which was a motive unto him after his returne from baniſhment to give generall thanks,<note place="margin">Cic.

            <p n="3">III.

And ſurely I am perſwaded that this hath bin a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150781:96"/> great cauſe <hi>why the happy progreſsion of Learning hitherto hath bin retarded;</hi> becauſe theſe Fundamentalls have bin ſtudied but only in paſſage, and deeper draughts have not bin taken thereof: <hi>For if you will have a Tree bear more fruit than it hath uſed to doe,</hi> it is not any thing you can doe to the boughes, but it is the ſtirring of the earth about the root, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of new mould, or you doe nothing. Neither is it to be paſs'd over in ſilence, <hi>that this dedicating of Colledges and Societies, only to the uſe of Profeſſory Learning, hath, not only, bin an enemy to the growth of Sciences; but hath redounded likewiſe to the prejudice of States and Governments:</hi> For hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly falls out that Princes, when they would make choice of Miniſters fit for the Affaires of State, finde about them ſuch a marveilous ſolitude of able men; becauſe there is no education Collegiate deſign'd to this end, where ſuch as are fram'd and fitted by nature thereto, might give themſelves chiefly to <hi>Hiſtories,</hi> Moderne <hi>Languages,</hi> Books and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Policy,</hi> that ſo they might come more able and better furniſht to ſervice of State.</p>
            <p>§ And becauſe <hi>Founders of Colledges doe Plant, and Founders of Lecturers doe water,</hi> it followeth now in order to ſpeak of the Defects which are in publique Lectures, <hi>the ſmallneſſe of ſtipends</hi> (eſpecially with us) <hi>aſsigned to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Arts or of Profeſsions:</hi> For it doth much import to the <hi>Progreſsion and Proficiency of Sciences,</hi> that Readers in every kinde be choſen out of the ableſt and moſt ſufficient men; as thoſe that are ordained, not for tranſitory uſe, but for to maintaine and propagate the ſeeds of Sciences for future A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; This cannot be, except the Rewards and Conditions be appointed ſuch, as may ſufficiently content the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent man in that Art, ſo as he can be willing to ſpend his whole Age in that function and never deſire to Practiſe.

            <p>§ Now I will note another <hi>Defect,</hi> wherein ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymiſt ſhould be called unto for help; for this Sect of Men adviſe Students to ſell their Bookes and to build Fornaces; to quit <hi>Minerva</hi> and the Muſes, as Barren Virgins, and to apply themſelves to <hi>Vulcane.</hi> Yet certainly it muſt be confeſt, that unto the depth of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and the fruit of <hi>Operative ſtudies</hi> in many Sciences, eſpecially <hi>Naturall Philoſophy,</hi> and <hi>Phyſique; Bookes are not the only ſubſidiary Jnstruments,</hi> wherein the Munificence of men, hath not bin altogether wanting; for we ſee <hi>Spheres, Globes, Aſtrolabes, Maps,</hi> and the like, have bin provided, and with induſtry invented, as Helps to <hi>Aſtronomy</hi> and <hi>Coſmography;</hi> as well as <hi>Bookes.</hi> We ſee likewiſe ſome places dedicated to the ſtudy of <hi>Phyſique,</hi> to have <hi>Gardens for the inſpection and obſervation of ſimples</hi> of all ſorts; and to be auctorized the uſe of <hi>Dead Bodies for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomy-Lectures.</hi> But thoſe doe reſpect but a few things; in the generality ſet it down for Truth, <hi>That there can hardly be made any maine Proficience in the diſcloſing of the ſecrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſſe there be liberall Allowance for Experiments; whether of</hi> Vulcan <hi>or of</hi> Daedalus; <hi>J mean of Fornace, or of Engine, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other kind:</hi> And therefore <hi>as Secretaries and Spialls of State,</hi> are allowed to bring in Bills for their diligence in the inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſcovery of New Occurrences and Secrets in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Eſtates; <hi>ſo you muſt allow Jntelligencers and Spialls of Nature their Bills of Expences;</hi> elſe you ſhall never be adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed of many things moſt worthy to be known. For if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander made ſuch a liberall Aſsignation of Treaſure unto Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> for Hunters, Fowlers, Fiſhers, and the like, that he might compile a Hiſtory of living Creatures; certainly much more is their merit, who wander not in wild forreſts of Nature, but make themſelves a way through the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths of Arts.</p>
            <pb n="73" facs="tcp:150781:97"/>
            <p>§ Another Defect to be obſerved by us (indeed of great import) is, <hi>A neglect, in thoſe which are Governours in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, of Conſultation; and in Princes and ſuperior Perſons, of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation; to this end, that it may with all diligence be conſidered and conſulted of, whether the Readings, Diſputations and other Scholaſticall exerciſes, anciently inſtituted, will be good to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, or rather to antiquate and ſubstitute others more effectuall:</hi> For amongſt Your Majeſties moſt wiſe maxims, I find this, <hi>That in all uſages and Praeſidents,</hi>
               <note place="margin">IACOBUS R.</note> 
               <hi>the times be conſidered wherein they firſt began; which if they were weak or ignorant, it derogateth from the Authority of the uſage and leaves it for ſuſpect.</hi> Therefore in as much as the uſages and orders of Univerſities, were for moſt part derived from times more obſcure and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned than our own, it is the more reaſon that they be re-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. In this kind I will give an inſtance or two for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſake, in things that ſeem moſt obvious and familiar. <hi>Jt is an uſuall practice (but in my opinion ſomewhat prepoſterous) that Schollars in the Vniverſities, are two early entred in Logique and Rhetorique; Arts indeed fitter for Graduats than Children and Novices.</hi> For theſe two (if the matter be well weighed) are in the number of the graveſt Sciences, being the <hi>Arts of Arts, the one for Judgement, the other for Ornament.</hi> So likewiſe they contain Rules and Directions, either for the Diſpoſition or Illuſtration of any ſubject or materiall Circumſtance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and therefore for mindes empty and unfraught with matter, &amp; which have not as yet gathered that which <hi>Cicero</hi> calls <hi>Silva</hi> and <hi>Supellex,</hi> that is ſtuffe and variety of things; to begin with thoſe Arts, (as if one would learn to weigh, of meaſure, or paint the wind) doth work but this effect, that the virtue and ſtrength of theſe Arts, which are great and Univerſall, are almoſt made contemptible, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated either into <hi>Childiſh Sophiſtry or ridiculous Affectation;</hi> or at leaſt have bin embaſed in their reputation. And far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the untimely and unripe acceſsion to theſe Arts, hath drawn on by neceſſary conſequence; a watery and ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary delivery and handling thereof, as is fitted indeed to the capacities of Children. Another inſtance which I will ſet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:150781:98"/> downe as an Error now grown inveterate, long agoe in the Univerſities, and it is this; <hi>That in Scholaſticall exerciſes, there uſeth to be a divorſe, very prejudicious, between Invention and Memory: for there the most of their ſpeeches are either, altogether premeditate, ſo as they are uttered in the very preciſe forme of words they were conceived in, and nothing left to invention; or meerely extemporall, ſo as very litle is left to Memory;</hi> Whereas in Life and Action, there is very litle uſe of either of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, but rather of their intermixture; that is, of notes or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morialls; and of extemporall ſpeech: So as by this courſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes are not accommodate to practice, nor the Jmage an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to the Life. And it is ever a true rule in <hi>exerciſes, that all, as neere as may be, ſhould repreſent thoſe things which in common courſe of life uſe to be practiſed;</hi> otherwiſe they will pervert the motions and faculties of the mind, and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them. The truth whereof is plainly diſcovered, when Schollars come to the Practice of their Profeſsions, or other Actions of Civile life, which when they ſet into, this defect, whereof we ſpeak, is ſoon found out by themſelves, but ſooner by others. But this part, <hi>touching the amendment of the Jnſtitutions of the Vniverſities,</hi> I will conclude, with the clauſe of <hi>Caeſars</hi> letter to <hi>Oppius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cic. Epiſt. Ad Att. lib. IX.</note>

            </p>
            <p>§ Another <hi>Defect</hi> which I note, aſcendes a litle high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the precedent: <hi>For as the progreſsion of Learning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth much in the wiſe Government and Inſtitution of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in particular; ſo it would be more advanced, if the Vniverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in generall, diſperſed through all Europe, were united in a nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer conjunction and correſpondence by mutuall Jntelligence.</hi> For there are, as we ſee, many Orders and Societies, which, though they be divided under ſeverall Soveraignties &amp; ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Territories, yet they doe contract and maintaine a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety and a kind of <hi>Fraternity</hi> one with another; in ſo much that they have their <hi>Provincialls</hi> and <hi>Generalls,</hi> to whom all the reſt yeeld obedience. And ſurely as nature creates <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hoods</hi> in <hi>Families;</hi> and Arts Mechanicall contract <hi>Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-hoods
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:150781:98"/> in Communalties;</hi> the Anointment of God ſuper-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a <hi>brother-hood in Kings and Biſhops;</hi> Vowes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall rules unite a <hi>Brotherhood in Orders.</hi> in like manner there cannot but intervene <hi>a Noble and Generous Fraternity between men by Learning and Illuminations;</hi> reflecting upon that relation which is attributed to God, who himſelfe is called, <hi>The Father of Illuminations or Lights.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§ Laſtly, this I find fault with, which I ſomewhat toucht upon before, <hi>that there hath not bin, or very rarely bin, any publique deſignation of able men, who might write or make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of ſuch parts of Learning as have not bin hitherto ſufficiently laboured and ſubdued.</hi> Vnto which point it will be very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable, if there were erected a kind of <hi>viſitation of Learning;</hi> and a Cenſe or Eſtimate taken, what parts of Learning are rich and well improved; what poore and deſtitute: For <hi>the opinion of Plenty is amongſt the Cauſes of want;</hi> and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Bookes makes a ſhew rather of ſuperfluity than pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury. Which ſurcharge, nevertheleſſe, if a man would make a right judgement, is not remedied by ſuppreſsing or extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing books heretofore written, but by publiſhing good new bookes, which may be of ſuch a right kind, <hi>That,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§ The Remedies of theſe <hi>defects</hi> now enumerate, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the laſt, and of the laſt alſo, in reſpect of the Active part thereof, which is the <hi>Deſignation of writers,</hi> are <hi>opera Baſilica,</hi> towards which the endeavours and induſtry of a private man, are commonly but as an Image in a croſſe way, which may point at the way, but cannot goe it: But the <hi>ſpeculative part, which pertaineth to the examination of knowledges,</hi> namely, <hi>what is Deficient in every particular Science,</hi> is open to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of a private man. <hi>Wherefore my Deſignement is to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a generall and faithfull perambulation and viſitation of Learning, ſpecially with a diligent and exact enquiry, what parts thereof lye freſh and waſt, and are not yet improved and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to uſe by the industry of men;</hi> to the end that ſuch a plot made, and recorded to memory, may miniſter light both to publique Deſignations, and the voluntary labours of private
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:150781:99"/> endeavours. Wherein nevertheleſſe my purpoſe is, at this time, <hi>to note only Omiſsions and Deficiencies, and not to make redargution of Errors and Overſights:</hi> For it is one thing to ſet forth what ground lieth unmanur'd, and another thing, to correct ill husbandry in that which is manured.</p>
            <p>§ In the undertaking and handling of which worke I am not ignorant what a buſineſſe I move, and what a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult province I ſuſtaine, and alſo, how unequall my abilities are unto my will: yet I have a good hope, that if my extreme love to Learning carrry me too farre, I may obtaine the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of affection, for that, it is <hi>not granted to man, To love and to be wiſe.</hi> I know well that I muſt leave the ſame liberty of judgement to others, that I uſe my ſelfe; and, in truth, I ſhall be indifferently glad, to accept from others, as to impart that duty of humanity;<note place="margin">Cic.

But on the contrary, this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth ſhould be throughly ſetled in the minds of men, <hi>That Artificialls differ not from Naturalls in Forme and Eſſence; but in the Efficient only;</hi> for man hath no power over <hi>Nature</hi> ſave only in her <hi>Motion;</hi> that is, to mingle or put together Naturall bodies, and to ſeparate or put them aſunder; wherefore where there is <hi>Appoſition and Seperation</hi> of <hi>Bodies, Naturall conjoyning</hi> (as they terme it) <hi>Active with Paſsive,</hi> man may doe all things; this not done, he can doe nothing. Nor is it materiall ſo things be managed in a right order, for the production of ſuch an effect, whether this be done by the Art of Man or without the Art of Man. Gold is ſometimes diſgeſted and purged from crudities and impurities, by fire; ſometimes found pure in ſmall ſands, Nature performing her own worke. So the Raine-Bow is formed of a dewy cloude in the Aire above; form'd alſo by aſperſion of water by us below. Therefore Nature commandeth all, and theſe three are her ſubſtitute Adminiſtrators, <hi>The courſe</hi> of <hi>Nature; the Expatiation of Nature and Art; or the Cooperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man with Nature in particulars.</hi> Wherefore it is very proportionable that theſe three be comprized in Naturall Hiſtory,<note place="margin">C. Plin. Nat. Hiſt.</note> which C. <hi>Plinius</hi> for moſt part performed, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone comprehended <hi>Naturall Hiſtory</hi> according to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof, but what he thus comprehended he hath not
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:150781:101"/> handled as was meet, nay rather foulely abuſed.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The firſt of theſe is extant in ſome good perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>The two latter are handled ſo weakly and ſo unprofitably, that they may be referr'd to the list of</hi> DEFICIENTS.<note place="margin">✿</note> For you ſhall find no ſufficient and competent collection of thoſe works of <hi>Nature which have a Digreſsion and Deflection from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary courſe of Generations, Productions and Motions;</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the ſingularities of certain Countries and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the ſtrange events of times; or the wit of chance, or the effects of latent proprieties; or <hi>Monodicalls of Nature</hi> in their kinde. Jt is true, there are a number of Bookes more than enough, full fraught with fabulous Experiments, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Secrets, and frivolous Impoſtures, for pleaſure and ſtrangeneſſe; but a ſubſtantiall and ſevere <hi>Collection of Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roclites,</hi> and of the <hi>wonders</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> diligently examined and faithfully deſcribed, <hi>this, I ſay, J finde not,</hi> eſpecially with due rejection, and, as it were, publique proſcription of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths and fables, which have got up into credit. For as the matter is now carried, if any untruths touching <hi>Nature</hi> be once on foot and celebrated (whether it be the Reverence of Antiquity, that can thus farre countenance them; or that it is a trouble to call them unto a re-examination; or that they are held to be rare ornaments of ſpeech, for ſimilitudes and compariſons) they are never after exterminate and called in. The uſe of this work honour'd with a Preſident in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Mirab.</note> is nothing leſſe than to give contentment to curious and vaine wits, as the manner of <hi>Mirabilaries</hi> and the <hi>ſpreaders of invented Prodigies</hi> is to doe; but for two reaſons ſerious and grave; the one to correct the partiality of Axioms, which are commonly grounded upon common and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar examples; the other becauſe from the <hi>wonder of Nature,</hi> a faire and open paſſage is made to the <hi>wonders of Art.</hi> For the buſines in this matter is no more than by quick ſent to trace out the footings of nature in hir willfull wanderings; that ſo afterward you may be able at your pleaſure, to lead or force her to the ſame place and poſtures againe.</p>
               <p>§ Neither doe I give in precept that ſuperſtitious Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations

Neither ſurely ought a man to make ſcruple of entring and penetrating the vaults and receſſes of theſe Arts, that propoſeth to himſelfe only the inquiſition of <hi>Truth,</hi>

And certainly this may be averr'd for truth, that they be not the higheſt inſtances, that give the beſt and ſureſt information. This is not unaptly expreſt in the Tale, ſo common, of the Philoſopher,<note place="margin">Laert. in Thalete.</note> 
                  <hi>That while he gaz'd upward to the ſtarres fell into the water:</hi> for if he had lookt down, he might have ſeen the ſtarres in the water; but look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to heaven he could not ſee the water in the ſtarres. In like manner it often comes to paſſe that ſmall and mean things conduce more to the diſcovery of great matters, than great things to the diſcovery of ſmall matters; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> notes well,<note place="margin">Pol. lib. 1.</note>

So we ſee that ſecret of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (eſtimed one of the great myſteries) of the turning of Iron toucht with a Loadſtone towards the Poles, was found out in needles of Iron, not in barres of Iron.</p>
               <p>§ But if my judgement be of any waight, I am wholly of this mind, that the uſe of <hi>Mechanicall Hiſtory,</hi> to the raiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy,</hi> is of all other the moſt radicall and fundamentall; ſuch Naturall Philoſophy, I underſtand

But before we diſmiſſe this part of <hi>Naturall Hiſtory,</hi> which we call <hi>Mechanicall</hi> and <hi>Experimentall,</hi> this muſt be added; That the body of <hi>ſuch a Hiſtory,</hi> muſt be built not only upon <hi>Mechanicall Arts themſelves,</hi> but the <hi>operative part of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſciences,</hi> as alſo upon many practices not yet grown up into Art, that nothing profitable may be omitted, which availes to the information of the underſtanding.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ivile Hiſtory,</hi> in our Judgement, is rightly divided into three kindes; firſt into <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi> then into that which retaines the generall name <hi>Civile;</hi> laſtly into that of <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Arts.</hi> We will begin with that kinde we ſet down laſt, becauſe the other are extant, <hi>but this I thought good to report as</hi> DEFICIENT;<note place="margin">✿</note> it is the HISTORY OF LEARNING. And ſurely the <hi>Hiſtory of the world</hi> deſtitute of this, may be thought not unlike the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Polyphemus,</hi> with his eye out, that part of the Image being wanting, which doth moſt ſhew the nature and ſpirit of the Perſon. And though we ſet downe this as <hi>Deficient,</hi> yet we are not ignorant, that in divers particular ſciences of Iuris-conſults, Mathematicians, Rhetoricians, Philoſophers, there are made ſome ſlight Memorialls and ſmall relations of Sects, Schooles, Books, Authors and ſuch like ſucceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſciences. There are likewiſe extant, ſome weak and barren diſcourſes touching the <hi>Inventors of Arts and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages;</hi> but a Iuſt and Generall HISTORY OF LEARNING, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch that none hetherto hath bin publiſht. Wherefore we will propound the Argument; the way how to contrive it, and the uſe thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Argument is nothing elſe but a recitall from all Times, what Knowledges and Arts, in what Ages and Climates of the world have floriſht.</hi> Let there be made a commemoration of their <hi>Antiquities, Progreſſes</hi> and <hi>Peragrations,</hi> through di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe parts of the world: (for Sciences ſhift and remove, as people doe,) Againe of their <hi>Declenſions, Oblivions,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaurations.</hi> Let there likewiſe be obſervations taken through all <hi>Arts,</hi> of the <hi>occaſion and originall of their Jnven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:150781:105"/> of their <hi>Manner of delivery,</hi> and the diſcipline of their managings, <hi>Courſe of ſtudy</hi> and exerciſes. Let there alſo be added the <hi>Sects</hi> then on foot; and the <hi>more famous controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> which buſied and exerciſed Learned men; the Scandalls and reproches to which they lay open; the Lands and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours wherewith they were grac't. Let there be noted the <hi>Chiefeſt Authors,</hi> the <hi>beſt Bookes, Schooles, Succeſsions, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, Societies, Colledges, Orders,</hi> and whatſoever elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the State of Learning. But above all, let this be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved (which is the Grace and Spirit of <hi>Civile Hiſtory,</hi>) that the Cauſes and Conſultations be Connexed, with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents: namely, that <hi>the nature of Countries and People be recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the diſpoſitions apt and able; or inept and inable for diverſe diſciplines; the Occurrences of time Adverſe, or Propitious to Learning; the zeales and mixtures of Religions, the Diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and favours of Lawes, and laſtly, the eminent virtues and ſway of Perſons of note, for the promoteing of Learning; and the like.</hi> But our adviſe is, that all theſe points be ſo handled, that time be not waſted in praiſe and cenſure of particulars, after the manner of <hi>Critiques;</hi> but that things be plainly and hiſtorically related, and our own judgements very ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interpoſed.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for the manner of compileing ſuch a Hiſtory,</hi> we doe eſpecially admoniſh thus much; <hi>that the Matter and Proviſion thereof, be drawn, not only from Histories and Critiques; but alſo that through every century of years or leſſer Intervalls, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſequence of time, deduced from the highest antiquity; the beſt Bookes written within thoſe distinguiſht ſpaces of time, be conſulted with;</hi> that from a taſt and obſervation of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtile and method thereof, and not a through per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſall, for that <hi>were an infinite work, the learned ſpirit of that age, as by a kind of charme, may be awakt and rais'd up from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>As touching the uſe of this Work,</hi> it is deſign'd to this end, not, that the Honour and State of Learning uſher'd in by ſo many Images and Ghoſts of the Learned, ſhould be celebrated; or that for the earneſt affection we bear to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:150781:105"/> we deſire, even to a curioſity, to enquire, and know, and to conſerve whatſoever to the ſtate of Learning may any way appertaine; but chiefly, for a more ſerious and grave purpoſe. It is, in few words this, <hi>For that ſuch a Narration, as we have deſcribed, in our opinion, may much conferre to the wiſdome and judgement of Learned men, in the uſe and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Learning: and that the paſsions and perturbations; the vices and virtues; as well about Intellectuall matters, as Civile, may be obſerved; and the beſt Preſidents for practiſe may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therefrom.</hi> For it is not Saint <hi>Auſtines,</hi> nor Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> workes, (as we ſuppoſe) that will make ſo wiſe a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop or a Divine, as <hi>Eccleſiaſticall story</hi> throughly read and obſerved: which without queſtion may befall Learned men from the Hiſtory of Learning.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ivile Hiſtory is of three kinds,</hi> not unfitly to be compared to the three ſorts of Pictures or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: for of Pictures and Images we ſee, ſome are unperfect and unfiniſht; others perfect; and others decayed and defaced with Age. In like manner we will divide <hi>Civile Hiſtory, which is the Image of Actions and Times,</hi> into three kindes, agreeable to thoſe of Pictures; namely, <hi>Memorials; Perfect Hiſtory;</hi> and <hi>Antiquities. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials are Histories unfiniſht,</hi> or the firſt and rough draughts of Hiſtory: <hi>Antiquities, are Hiſtories defaced,</hi> or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines of Hiſtory, which have caſually eſcaped the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of Time.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Memorials or Preparations to Hiſtory,</hi> are of two ſorts, whereof one may be termed <hi>Commentaries;</hi> the other <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters. Commentaries</hi> let downe a naked Continuance and Connexion of Actions and Events, without the Cauſes and Pre-texts of Buſineſſe; the beginings and Motives thereof; alſo the Counſels and Speeches, and other preparations of Actions: For this is the true nature of <hi>Commentaries,</hi> though <hi>Caeſar</hi> in modeſty mixt with greatneſſe, did for his pleaſure apply the name of <hi>Commentaries,</hi> to the beſt Hiſtory that is extant. But <hi>Regiſters</hi> are of two ſorts, for either they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the titles of Matter &amp; Perſons in a continuation of Times, ſuch as are <hi>Calendars</hi> and <hi>Cronologies:</hi> or <hi>Solennities</hi> of <hi>Acts;</hi> of which kind are the Edicts of Princes; the Decrees of Counſils; the Proceedings of Iudgements; Publique Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Letters or Eſtate and the like; without the Contexture or Continued thred of the <hi>Narration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Antiquities,</hi> or the <hi>Remaines of Hiſtories,</hi> are as we ſaid, <hi>tanquam Tabula Naufragii;</hi> when induſtrious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150781:107"/> perſons (the memory of Things being decaied and almoſt overwhelmed with oblivion) by a conſtant and ſcrupulous diligence, out of Geneologies, Calendars, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, Monuments, Coines, Proper-names, and ſtiles; Etymologies of words, Proverbs, Traditions, Archives, and Jnſtruments, as well publique as private; Fragments of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſcattered paſſages of Books that concerne not Hiſtory; out of all theſe I ſay, or ſome of them, they recover and ſave ſomewhat from the Deluge of Time. Certainly a painefull work, but acceptable to all ſorts of Men, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a kind of Reverence, and indeed worthy (all Fabulous Originals of Nations defac'd, and extinguiſht) to be ſubſtituted in the roome of ſuch counterfeit ſtuffe: but yet of the leſſe Authority, becauſe what is proſtitute to the licenſe of private deſignes, looſes the honour of publique re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſt</hi> or <hi>Perfect Hiſtory,</hi> is of three kinds, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of the object which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds to repreſent; for it either repreſents a portion of Time; or ſome memorable Perſon; or ſome Famous Act: The firſt we call <hi>Chronicles</hi> or <hi>Annals;</hi>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:150781:107"/> the ſecond <hi>Lives;</hi> the third <hi>Relations.</hi> Of theſe, <hi>Chronicles</hi> ſeem to excell, for Celebrity and Name; <hi>Lives,</hi> for profit and examples; <hi>Relations,</hi> for ſincerity and verity. <hi>For Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, repreſent the magnitude of publique Actions, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne faces of Men, as they regard the publique, and involue in ſilence ſmaller Paſſages, which pertaine either to Matter or Men.</hi> And ſeeing it is the workmanſhip of God alone, <hi>to hang the greateſt waight upon the ſmalleſt wyers;</hi> it comes many times to paſſe, that ſuch a Hiſtory purſueing only the greater oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, rather ſets forth the Pompe and Solennity; than the true reſorts, and the intrinſeque contextures of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And although it doth adde and intermixe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils themſelves; yet affecting greatneſſe, it doth beſprinkle mens actions with more ſolemneneſſe and wiſdome, than indeed is in them; <hi>that a Satyre may be a truer table of a Mans life, than many ſuch Hiſtories.</hi> Contrariwiſe; <hi>Lives,</hi> if they be well written with diligence and judgement (for we doe not ſpeak of <hi>Elogies</hi> and ſuch ſlight commemorations) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they propound unto themſelves ſome particular perſon, in whom Actions, as well commune as ſolemne; ſmall as great; private as publique, have a compoſition and commixture; yet, certainly, they exhibite more lively and faithfull Narrations of Matters; and which you may more ſafely and ſucceſſefully transferre into example. But ſpeciall <hi>Relations of Actions,</hi> ſuch as are the <hi>warres of Peloponeſus;</hi> the <hi>Expedition of Cyrus;</hi> the <hi>Conſpiracy of Cataline,</hi> and the like, ought to be attired with a more pure and ſyncere Candor of Truth than the <hi>Perfect Hiſtories of Times;</hi> becauſe in them may be choſen an Argument more particular and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible; and of that quality, as good notice and certitude, and full information, may be had thereof whereas, on the contrary, the <hi>story of Time</hi> (ſpecially more ancient than the age of the writer) doth often faile in the memory of things, and containeth blank ſpaces, which the wit and conjecture of the writer (confidently enough) uſeth to ſeize upon and fill up. Yet this which we ſay, touching the ſyncerity of <hi>Relations,</hi> muſt be underſtood with reſervation, for indeed
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:150781:108"/> it muſt be confeſſed (ſince all mortall good laboureth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and conveniences with diſconveniences are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally connext) that ſuch kind of <hi>Relations,</hi> ſpecially if they be publiſhed about the times of things done; ſeeing very often they are written with paſsion or partiality, of all other nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, are deſervedly moſt ſuſpected. But again, together with this inconvenience, this remedy groweth up; that theſe ſame <hi>Relations,</hi> being they are not ſet out by one ſide only, but through faction and partiary, affections are commonly publiſhed by ſome or other on both ſides; they doe by this means open and hedge in a midle way between extremes to truth: and after the heat of paſsions is over, they become, to a good and wiſe writer of Hiſtory, not the worſt matter and ſeedes of a perfect Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>§ As touching thoſe points which ſeem <hi>deficient</hi> in theſe three kinds of Hiſtory, without doubt there are many particular Hiſtories (of ſuch I ſpeak as may be had) of ſome dignity or mediocrity, which have bin hetherto paſſed by, to the great detriment of the honor and ſame of ſuch King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and States, to which they were due, which would be too tedious here to obſerve. But leaving the ſtories of forreigne Nations, to the care of Forreigne Perſons, leſt I ſhould become <hi>Curioſus in aliena Reipub.</hi> I cannot faile to repreſent unto Your Majeſty the indignity and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it now is, in the main con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation thereof, as alſo the partiality and obliquity of that of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in the lateſt and largeſt author thereof: ſuppoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it would be honour to Your Majeſty, and a work acceptable with Poſterity, if this Iland of <hi>Great Britany,</hi> as it is now joyned in a Monarchy for the Ages to come, ſo were joyned in one Hiſtory for the times paſt, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the ſacred Hiſtory, which draweth down the ſtory of the Ten Tribes, and of the two Tribes as Twinnes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And if it ſhall ſeem that the waight of the work; (which certainly is great and difficult) may make it leſſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, according to the worthineſſe thereof, performed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold an excellent period of much ſmaller compaſſe of time,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:150781:108"/> as to the ſtory of <hi>England;</hi> that is to ſay, from the uniting of the Roſes to the uniting of the Kingdomes; a ſpace of time, which in my judgment containes more variety of rare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, than in like number of ſucceſſions ever was knowne in an Hereditary Kingdome. For it begins with the mixt Title to a Crowne, partly by might partly by right: An en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by Armes; an eſtabliſhment by marriage; ſo there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed times anſwerable to theſe beginings; like waves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a great tempeſt, retaining their ſwellings and agitations, but without extremity of ſtorme;<note place="margin">HEN.

               </p>
               <p>§ As <hi>for Lives,</hi> when I think thereon, I doe find ſtrange that theſe our Times have ſo litle knowne, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150781:109"/> their owne virtues; <hi>being there is ſo ſildome any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials or Records of the lives af thoſe who have bin eminent in our Times.</hi> For although Kings and ſuch as have abſolute ſoveraignty, may be few; and Princes in free Common-wealths (ſo many States being collected into Monarchies,) are not many; yet however, there hath not bin wanting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men (though living under Kings,) that have deſerv'd better, than an incertain and wandring Fame of their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; or ſome barren &amp; naked Elogie. For herein the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of one of the late Poets, whereby he hath well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richt the ancient Fiction, is not inelegant: <hi>Hee faines that at the end of the Thread of every mans life, there was a Medall or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blet, whereon the name of the Dead was ſtampt;</hi> and that time waited upon the ſheeres of the fatall Siſter, and as ſoone as the Thread was cut, caught the Medalls, and carrying them away; a litle after threw them out of his Boſome into the River Lethe And that about the Bank there were many Birds flying up and downe, that would get the Medals; and after they had carried them in their beakes a litle while, ſoon after, through negligence ſuffered them to fall into the River. Amongſt theſe Birds there were a few <hi>ſwannes</hi> found, which if they got a Medall with a name, they uſed to carry it to a certaine <hi>Temple conſecrate to Immortality.</hi> But ſuch <hi>ſwannes</hi> are rare in our Age. And although many men more mortall in their vigilancies and ſtudies, than in their bodies, deſpiſe the <hi>Memory of their Name,</hi> as if it were fume or ayre,<note place="margin">Plin. Iun. alicubi in Epiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Animae nil magnae laudis egentes:</hi> namely whoſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and ſeverity ſprings from that roote, <hi>Non prius lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des contempſimus quam laudandafacere deſcivimus.</hi> Yet that wil not with us,<note place="margin">Prov. 10.</note> prejudicate <hi>Salomon's</hi> Iudgment, <hi>The memory of the Iuſt is with Benediction; but the name of the wicked ſhall putrifie:</hi> The one perpetually floriſhes; the other either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly departs into Oblivion; or diſſolves into an ill Odor. And therefore in that ſtile and forme of ſpeaking, which is very well brought in uſe, attributed to the Dead, of <hi>Happy Memory;</hi> of <hi>Pious Memory;</hi> of <hi>Bleſſed Memory;</hi> we ſeeme to acknowledge that which <hi>Cicero</hi> alleageth; borrowing it

               <p>§ <hi>As concerning Relations</hi> it could be in truth; wiſh't, that there were a greater diligence taken therein: For there is no Action more eminent, that hath not ſome able Pen to attend it, which may take and tranſcribe it. And becauſe it is a Quality not common to all men to write a <hi>Perfect Hiſtory</hi> to the Life and Dignity thereof; (as may well appear by the ſmall number, even of mean Writers in that kind) yet if par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Actions were but by a tolerable Pen reported, as they paſſe, it might be hoped that in ſome after Age, Writers might ariſe, that might compile a <hi>Perfect Hiſtory</hi> by the helpe an asſiſtance of ſuch <hi>Notes:</hi> For ſuch <hi>Collections</hi> might be as a <hi>Nurſery Garden,</hi> whereby to Plant a faire and ſtately Garden, when time ſhould ſerve.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Iſtory Eccleſiaſticall</hi> falls under the ſame diviſion commonly with <hi>Civile Hiſtory;</hi> for there are <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Chronicles;</hi> there are <hi>Lives</hi> of <hi>Fathers;</hi> there are <hi>Relations</hi> of <hi>Synods,</hi> and the like, pertaining to the <hi>Church.</hi> In proper expreſſion this kind of Hiſtory is divided, <hi>into the Hiſtory of the Church by a generall name; Hiſtory of Propheſy; and Hiſtory of Providence.</hi> The firſt recordeth the times and different ſtate of the <hi>Church Militant;</hi> whether ſhe flote as the <hi>Arke in the Deluge;</hi> or ſojourne <hi>as the Arke in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſse;</hi> or be at reſt <hi>as the Arke in the Temple;</hi> that is, the State of the Church in <hi>Perſecution;</hi> in <hi>Remove;</hi> and in <hi>Peace.</hi> In this Part I find no <hi>Deficience;</hi> but rather more things abound therein, than are wanting; only this I could wiſh, that the virtue and ſyncerity of the Narrations were anſwerable to the greatneſſe of the Maſſe.</p>
               <p n="2">II The Second Part which is the <hi>History of Propheſie,</hi> conſiſteth of two Relatives; the <hi>Propheſy it ſelfe;</hi> and the <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment thereof.</hi> wherefore the deſigne of this worke ought to be, that every <hi>Propheſy of Scripture</hi> be ſorted with the truth of the event; and that throughout all the ages of the world; both for Confirmation of Faith; as alſo to plant a Diſcipline; &amp; skill in the Interpretation of <hi>Propheſies,</hi> which are not yet accompliſh't. But in this work, that latitude muſt be allowed which is proper, and familiar unto <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies;</hi> that their accompliſhments may be both perpetuall and punctual. For they reſemble the nature of their Auctor <hi>to whom one day is as a thouſand yeares,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal</hi> 90</note> 
                  <hi>and a thouſand yeares are but as one day:</hi> And though the fulneſſe, and height of their complement be many times aſſigned to ſome certaine age,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:150781:112"/> or certaine point of time; yet they have nevertheleſſe many ſtaires and ſcales of Accompliſhment throughout diverſe Ages of the world. This worke I ſet down as DEFICIENT;<note place="margin">✿</note> but it is of that nature as muſt be handled with great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſobriety, and reverence, or not at all.</p>
               <p n="3">III The third Part which is the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> hath fallen indeed upon the Pens of many pious Writers, but not without ſiding of Partiaries; and it is imployed <hi>in the obſervation of that divine Correſpondence which often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth betweene Gods revealed Will, and his ſecret Will.</hi> For though the Counſils, and Iudgments of God be ſo obſcure, that they are <hi>inſcrutable to the Naturall man;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> yea many times withdraw themſelves even from <hi>their</hi> eyes, that look out of the Tabernacle: Yet ſometimes by turns it pleaſeth the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdome for the Confirmation of <hi>this;</hi> and Confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe which are <hi>as without God in the world;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Epheſ. 2.</note> to propoſe them to be ſeen written in ſuch Capitall Letters, that, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Every one that runnes by, may read them;</hi>

               <p>there are <hi>fain'd Chronicles, fain'd Lives,</hi> and <hi>fain'd Relations</hi>) is this, <hi>that it is either Narrative; or Repreſentative, or Alluſive. Narrative is a meere imitation of Hiſtory,</hi> that in a manner it deceives us; but that often it extolls matters above beliefe. <hi>Drammaticall or Repreſentative, is as it were, a viſible History;</hi> for it ſets out the Image of things, as if they were Preſent; and <hi>History,</hi> as if they were Paſt. <hi>Parabolicall or Alluſive is Hiſtory with the Type, which brings downe the Images of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to the Objects of Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ As for <hi>Narrative Poeſy,</hi> or if you pleaſe <hi>Heroicall</hi> (ſo you underſtand it of the <hi>Matter,</hi> not of the <hi>Verſe</hi>) it ſeems to be raiſed altogether from a noble foundation; which makes much for the Dignity of mans Nature. For ſeeing this ſenſible world, is in dignity inferior to the ſoule of Man; <hi>Poeſy</hi> ſeems to endow Humane Nature with that which <hi>Hiſtory</hi> denies; and to give ſatisfaction to the Mind, with, at leaſt, the ſhadow of things, where the ſubſtance cannot be had. For if the matter be throughly conſidered; a ſtrong Argument may be drawn from <hi>Poeſy,</hi> that a more ſtately greatneſſe of things; a more Perfect Order; and a more beautifull variety delights the ſoule of Man, than any way can be found in Nature, ſince the Fall. Wherefore ſeeing the Acts and events, which are the ſubject of true <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> are not of that amplitude, as to content the mind of Man; <hi>Poeſy</hi> is ready at hand to faine <hi>Acts</hi> more <hi>Heroicall.</hi> Becauſe <hi>true History</hi> reports the ſucceſſes of buſineſſe, not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the merit of Virtues and Vices; <hi>Poeſy</hi> corrects it, and preſents events and Fortunes according to deſert, and according to the Law of Providence: becauſe <hi>true History,</hi> through the frequent ſatiety and ſimilitude of Things, workes a diſtaſt and miſpriſion in the mind of Man; <hi>Poeſy</hi> cheereth and refreſhes the ſoule; chanting things rare, and various, and full of viciſsitudes. So as <hi>Poeſy</hi> ſerveth and conferreth to Delectation, Magnanimity, and Morality; and therefore it may ſeem deſervedly to have ſome Participation of Divineneſſe; becauſe it doth raiſe the mind, and exalt the ſpirit with high raptures, by proportioning the ſhewes of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:150781:113"/> things to the deſires of the mind; and not ſubmitting the mind to things, as <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Hiſtory</hi> doe. And by theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, and congruities, whereby it cheriſheth the ſoule of man; joyned alſo with conſort of Muſique, whereby it may more ſweetly inſinuate it ſelfe, it hath wonne ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that it hath bin in eſtimation even in rude times, and Barbarous Nations, when other Learning ſtood excluded.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Drammaticall, or Repreſentative Poeſy, which brings the World upon the ſtage,</hi> is of excellent uſe, if it were not abuſed. For the Inſtructions, and Corruptions of the <hi>Stage,</hi> may be-great; but the corruptions in this kind abound; the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is altogether neglected in our times. For although in moderne Commonwealths, <hi>Stage-plaies</hi> be but eſtimed a ſport or paſtime, unleſſe it draw from the Satyre, and be mordant; yet the care of the Ancients was, that it ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the minds of men unto virtue. Nay, wiſe men and great Philoſophers, have accounted it, as the Archet, or muſicall Bow of the Mind. And certainly it is moſt true, and as it were, a ſecret of nature, <hi>that the minds of men are more patent to affections, and impreſsions, Congregate, than ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But <hi>Poeſy Alluſive, or Parabolicall, excells the reſt, and ſeemeth to be a ſacred and venerable thing; eſpecially ſeeing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelfe hath allowed it in a work of that nature, and by it, trafiques divine commodities with men.</hi> But even <hi>this</hi> alſo hath bin contaminate by the levity and indulgence of mens wits about <hi>Allegories.</hi> And it is of ambiguous uſe, and applied to contrary ends. For it ſerves for <hi>Obſcuration;</hi> and it ſerveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for <hi>Illuſtration:</hi> in this it ſeems there was ſought a way how to teach; in that an Art how to conceale. And this way of teaching which conduceth to <hi>Jllustration,</hi> was much in uſe in the Ancient times: for when the Inventions and concluſions of human reaſon, (which are now common and vulgar) were in thoſe ages ſtrange and unuſuall; the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings of men were not ſo capable of that ſubtilty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſuch diſcourſes, by reſemblances and examples, were brought downe to ſenſe. Wherefore in thoſe firſt ages all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:150781:114"/> were full of <hi>Fables,</hi> and of <hi>Parables,</hi> and of <hi>Aenigmaes,</hi> and of <hi>Similitudes</hi> of all ſorts. Hence the <hi>Symboles</hi> of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras;</hi> the <hi>Aenigmaes</hi> of <hi>Sphynx;</hi> and the <hi>Fables</hi> of <hi>Aeſop;</hi> and the like. So the <hi>Apophthegmes</hi> of the Ancient ſages, were likewiſe expreſſed by <hi>ſimilitudes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Liv. Hiſt. lib. 2.</note> So <hi>Menenius Agrippa,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Romans, a Nation in that age not learned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a ſedition by a Fable. <hi>And as Hieroglyphiques were before letters; ſo Parables were before Arguments.</hi> So even at this day, and ever, there is, and hath bin much life, and vigor in <hi>Parables;</hi> becauſe Arguments cannot be ſo ſenſible, nor examples ſo fit. <hi>There is another uſe of Parabolicall Poeſy, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the former, which tendeth to the folding up of thoſe things; the dignity whereof, deſerves to be retired, and diſtinguiſht, as with a drawn Curtain: That is when the ſecrets and myſteries of Religion, Policy, and Philoſophy are vailed, and invested with Fables, and Parables.</hi> But whether there be any myſticall ſenſe couched under the ancient <hi>Fables</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi> may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome doubt: and indeed for our part we incline to this opinion, as to think, that there was an infuſed myſtery in many of the ancient <hi>Fables</hi> of the <hi>Poets.</hi> Neither doth it move us that theſe matters are left commonly to Schoole-boyes, and Grammarians, and ſo are imbaſed, that we ſhould therefore make a ſlight judgement upon them: but contrariwiſe becauſe it is cleere that the <hi>writings</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite thoſe <hi>Fables</hi> of all the writings of men, next to ſacred writ, are the moſt ancient; and that the <hi>Fables</hi> themſelves, are farre more ancient than they (being they are alleadged by thoſe writers, not as excogitated by them, but as credited &amp; recepted before) they ſeem to be like a fine-delicate Aire blowen up and downe by a more Ancient Nation, and by derivation from them to have chanc'd into the Pipes of the Grecians; &amp; to have become their Des-cant; And becauſe that whatſoever hath hetherto bin undertaken for interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe <hi>Parables,</hi> namely by unskilfull men, not learned beyond common places, give us no ſatisfaction at all; we thought good to referre Philoſophy according to <hi>ancient Parables,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">✿</note> in the number of DEFICIENTS.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:150781:114"/>
               <p>§ And we will annex an example or two of this work: not that the matter perhaps is of ſuch moment: but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the purpoſe of our deſigne. That is this; that if any portion of theſe works which we report as <hi>Deficient,</hi> chance to be more obſcure than ordinary; that we alwaiſe propoſe, either Precepts, or Examples, for the perfecting of that work; leſt perchance ſome ſhould imagine, that our conceit hath only comprehended ſome light notions of them; and that we like Augures, only meaſure Countries in our mind, but know not how to ſet one foot forward thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for any other part defective in <hi>Poeſy,</hi> we find none; nay rather, <hi>Poeſy</hi> being a plant coming, as it were, from the luſt of a rank ſoile, without any certain ſeed, it hath ſprung up, and ſpread abroad above all other kind of Learning. But now we will propound examples, in number only three, one from things <hi>Naturall;</hi> one from <hi>Politicall;</hi> &amp; one from <hi>Morall.</hi>

But others though they affirm only one Principle of Nature (<hi>Thales</hi> water; <hi>Anaximenes</hi> Air;<note place="margin">Laert. in vitis.</note> 
                     <hi>Heraclitus</hi> Fire) yet they have defined that Principle, which is one in Act, to be various and diſpenſible in power; as that wherein the ſeeds of all naturall eſſences lie hidden. <hi>They</hi> who have introduced the firſt Matter every way diſarayed,<note place="margin">Jn Timaeo</note> and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and in different to any forme (as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did) came to a farre nearer,<note place="margin">phyſ.

So as all the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching the beginnings of things come to this point, and may be reduc'd to this diſtribution; that the world took beginning either from <hi>Mercury;</hi> or from <hi>Penelope;</hi> and all hir Suitors. <hi>The third</hi> conceit of <hi>Pans</hi> Originall is ſuch, as it ſeemes that the Grecians either by intercourſe with the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians; or one way or other, had heard ſomething of the Hebrew myſteries. For it points to the ſtate of the World not conſidered in the abſolute production; but as it ſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> expos'd and made ſubject to Death and Corruption: For in that ſtate it was, and remaines to this day; the off-ſpring of God, and of Sin, or <hi>Contumely.</hi>

For this <hi>Pan,</hi> as we now behold and comprehend it, took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining from the word of God, by the means of confuſed matter, which yet was the work of God, and the entrance of Prevarication, and through it of corruption.</p>
                  <p>§ The <hi>Deſtinies</hi> may well be thought the ſiſters of <hi>Pan,</hi> or <hi>Nature:</hi> for the beginings, and continuances, and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the Depreſsions alſo, and eminencies, and labours, and felicities of things; and whatſoever conditions of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Nature, are called <hi>Fates</hi> or <hi>Deſtinies:</hi> which yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in ſome noble individuate ſubject, as a Man, a Citty, or a Nation, commonly are not acknowledged. But <hi>Pan,</hi> that is, the <hi>Nature of things,</hi> is the cauſe of theſe ſeverall ſtates, and qualities in every particular; ſo as in reſpect of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividualls, the <hi>Chaine</hi> of nature, and the thred of the <hi>Deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> is the ſame. <hi>Moreover</hi> the Ancients fained, that <hi>Pan</hi> ever lived in the open Aire; but the PARCae, or <hi>Destinies,</hi> in a mighty ſubterraneous Cave; from whence with an infinite ſwiftneſſe they flew to men: becauſe the nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon face of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> is apert, and viſible; but the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall <hi>Fates</hi> of Particulars are ſecret, ſwift, and ſodain. But if <hi>Fate</hi> be taken in a more generall acception, as to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the more notable only, and not every common event; yet in that ſenſe alſo, the ſignification is correſpondent to the univerſall ſtate of things; ſeeing from the order of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> there is nothing ſo ſmall which comes to paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cauſe; and nothing ſo abſolutely great, as to be independent; ſo that the very Fabrique of <hi>Nature</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth in the lappe and boſome thereof, every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſmall or great; and by a conſtant rule diſcloſeth them in due ſeaſon. Wherefore no marvell if the PARCae be brought in as the legitimate Siſters of <hi>Pan:</hi> For <hi>Fortune</hi> is the daughter of the fooliſh vulgar; and found favour only with the more unſound Philoſophers. Certainly the words
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150781:116"/> of Epicurus ſavour leſſe of Dotage than of prophaneneſſe where he ſaith; <hi>Praestare credere fabulam Deorum,</hi>

But <hi>Epicurus</hi> (as it is evident from his own words) accommodating, and ſubjecting his <hi>Naturall Philoſophy</hi> to his <hi>Morall;</hi> would heare of no opinion which might preſſe and ſting the conſcience; or any way diſca lme, and trouble that, <hi>Euthymia,</hi> or <hi>Tranquility of mind,</hi> which hee had receiv'd from <hi>Democritus.</hi> Wherefore being more indulgent to the deluſions of his owne fancies, than patient of truth; he hath fairely caſt off the yoak, and abandon'd as well the <hi>Neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> as the <hi>Feare</hi> of the <hi>Gods.</hi> And thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Fraternity of <hi>Pan</hi> with the <hi>Deſtinies.</hi>

                  <p>§ <hi>Hornes</hi> are attributed unto the <hi>World,</hi> broad at the root, ſharpe at the top; the nature of all things being like a Pyramis leſſening upwards. For <hi>Individuals</hi> in which the Baſe of nature is ſpread out; being infinite, are collected into Species, which are many alſo; Species againe riſe up into Generalls; and theſe aſcending are contracted into more U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſall Generalities; ſo that at length, nature may ſeeme to cloſe in a <hi>unity;</hi> which is ſignified by the Pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal Figure of <hi>Pans Hornes.</hi> Neither is it to be wonder'd at, that <hi>Pan</hi> toucheth heaven with his <hi>horns;</hi> ſeeing the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals <hi>of Nature,</hi> or <hi>

                     <note place="margin">Iliad. IX.</note> doe in ſome ſort reach things Divine. Wherefore <hi>Homers famous Chaine of Naturall Cauſes, tyed to the foot of Iupiters Chaire,</hi> was celebrated. And it is plain, that no man converſant in <hi>Metaphyſique;</hi> &amp; thoſe things which in Nature are <hi>Eternall,</hi> and immoveable; and that hath never ſo litle withdrawn his mind from the fluid ruine of ſublunary things, which doth not at the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fall upon <hi>Naturall Theologie:</hi> ſo direct and compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a paſſage it is, from the top of the <hi>Pyramis,</hi> to Matters Divine.</p>
                  <p>§ The body of <hi>Nature</hi> is elegantly and lively drawne <hi>Hairy,</hi> repreſenting the beames of things; for beames are, as it were, the haires or briſtles of nature; and every Creature is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150781:117"/> more or leſſe Beamy; which is moſt apparant in the faculty of ſeeing; and no leſſe in every magnetique virtue, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon diſtance; for whatſoever worketh upon any thing upon Diſtance, that may rightly be ſaid to dart forth rayes. Moreover <hi>Pans beard</hi> is ſaid to be exceeding long, becauſe the beames or influences of the Heavens; and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the Sunne, doe operate, and pierce fartheſt of all; ſo that not only the ſurface, but the inward bowels of the earth have bin turn'd; ſubduc'd; and impregnate, with the maſculine Spirit of the heavenly influence. And the forme of <hi>Pans beard</hi> is the more elegant; becauſe the <hi>Sun</hi> when his higher part, is ſhadowed with a Cloud, his beams break out in the lower; and ſo appeares to the eye as if he were <hi>bearded.</hi>

                  <p>§ Nature alſo is moſt expreſſively ſet forth with a <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Body;</hi> in reference to the Differences betweene ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and inferior bodies. For the one part, by reaſon of their beauty; and equability; and conſtancy of motion; and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the earth; and earthly things; is aptly ſet out by the ſhape of man: And the other part in reſpect of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations; and irregular motions; and that they are for moſt part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded by the Celeſtiall; may be well fitted with the figure of a <hi>bruit beaſt.</hi> Againe this ſame <hi>bi-formed</hi> deſcription of his <hi>body,</hi> pertaines to the participation of the ſpecies or kind; for no ſpecies of Nature, ſeemes to be ſimple; but, as it were participating and compounded of two, Eſſentiall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients. For Man hath ſomething of a Beaſt: a Beaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Plant: a Plant ſomething of an inanimate Body: and all Natural things are indeed bi-formed; and compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a ſuperior and inferior kind.</p>
                  <p>§ It is a witty Allegory that ſame, of the <hi>feet of the Goat;</hi> by reaſon of the upward tending motions of Terreſtiall bodies towards the regions of the aire; and of the heaven; where alſo they become penſile; and from thence are rather forc'd downe, than fall downe. For the Goat is a mounting Animal, that loves to be hanging upon rocks, and precipices, &amp; ſteep hils: And this is done alſo in a wonderfull manner,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:150781:117"/> even by thoſe things which are deſtinated to this inferior Globe; as may manifeſtly appear, in <hi>Cloudes</hi> and <hi>Meteors.</hi> And it was not without the grounds of reaſon, that <hi>Gilbert,</hi>

                  <p>§ The two enſignes which <hi>Pan</hi> bears in his hands, doe point, the one at <hi>Harmony,</hi> the other at <hi>Empirie:</hi> for the <hi>Pipe of ſeven Reeds,</hi> doth evidently demonſtrate the conſent and <hi>Harmony;</hi> or diſcordant concord of Nature, which is cauſed by the motion of the ſeaven wandring ſtarres: for there are no other Errors, or manifeſt Expatiations in heaven, ſave thoſe of the ſeaven Planets; which being intermingled, and moderated with the equality of the fixed ſtarres; and their perpetuall and invariable diſtance one from the other, may maintaine and excite both the conſtancy in ſpecificall; and the fluency of Individuall Natures. If there be any leſſer Planets which are not conſpicuous; or any greater Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in heaven (as in many ſuperlunary Comets) they ſeem but like Pipes, either altogether mute, or only ſtreperous for a time, becauſe their influence either doth not ſtream down ſo low as to us; or doth not long interrupt the Harmony of the <hi>ſeaven Pipes of Pan.</hi> And that <hi>Staffe of Empirie,</hi> may be excellently applied to the order of Nature, which is partly right, partly crooked. And this ſtaffe or rodde is eſpecially crooked at the upper end; becauſe all the works of Divine Providence are commonly fetcht about by circuits, and windings; ſo that one thing may ſeem to be done, and yet indeed a clean contrary brought to paſſe; as <hi>the ſelling of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph into Aegypt,</hi> and the like.<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> Beſides in all wiſe humane Goverment, they that ſit at the helme, doe more happily bring their purpoſes about, and inſinuate more eaſily things fit for the people, by pretexts, and oblique courſes; than by downe-right dealing. Nay (which perchance may ſeem very ſtrange) in things meerely naturall, you may ſooner
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:150781:118"/> deceive nature, than force her; ſo improper, and ſelfe-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching are open direct proceedings; whereas on the other ſide, an oblique and an inſinuing way, gently glides along, and compaſſeth the intended effect.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Pans Cloak or Mantle,</hi> is ingeniouſly faigned to be the <hi>Skin of a Leopard,</hi> becauſe it is full of ſpots: ſo the Heavens are ſpotted with ſtarres; the Sea with Ilands; the Land with flowers; and every particular creature alſo, is for moſt part garniſhed with diverſe colours about the ſuperficies; which is, as it were a Mantle unto it.</p>
                  <p>§ The office of <hi>Pan</hi> could be by nothing ſo conceived; and expreſt to the life, as by faigning him to be the <hi>God of Hunters;</hi> for every naturall Action, and ſo by conſequence, motion and progresſion, is nothing elſe but a <hi>Hunting.</hi> Arts and Sciences have their works; and humane Counſils their ends, which they earneſtly <hi>hunt</hi> after.

                  <p>§ The <hi>Nymphs,</hi> that is the Soules of living things, give great delight to <hi>Pan:</hi> for the ſoules of the living are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the World. The <hi>Conduct</hi> of theſe Nymphs is with great reaſon attributed to <hi>Pan,</hi> becauſe theſe Nymphs, or Soules of the liveing, doe follow their naturall diſpoſition, as their guides; and with infinite variety every one of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the faſhion of his country, doth leap and dance with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant motion about hir.<note place="margin">N.

                     <hi>Wherefore one of the Moderne</hi> very ingeniouſly hath reduced all the power of the Soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Motion; noteing the miſpriſion, and precipitancy of ſome of the ancients; who fixing their eyes and thoughts with unadviſed haſt, upon Memory; Imagination, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, have paſt over the <hi>Cogitative faculty</hi> untoucht; which hath a chiefe part in the order of conception.

                  </p>
                  <p>§ The <hi>Satyres,</hi> and <hi>Sileni,</hi> are perpetuall followers of <hi>Pan,</hi> that is old age and youth: for of all naturall things, there is a lively, jocund, and (as I may ſay) a danceing age; and a dull, flegmatique age: the carriages and diſpoſitions of both which ages, may peradventure ſeeme, to a man which ſeriouſly obſerves them, as ridiculous and deformed, as thoſe of the <hi>Satyres,</hi> or of the <hi>Sileni.</hi>

                  <p>§ Touching the <hi>Terrors which Pan is ſaid to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of,</hi> there may be made a wiſe inſtruction; namely, <hi>that Nature hath implanted in every living thing, a kind of care and feare, tending to the preſervation of its own life, and being; and to the repelling and ſhunning of all hurtfull encounters.</hi> And yet Nature knows not how to keepe a mean, but alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixeth vaine and empty fears, with ſuch as are diſcreet and profitable; ſo that all things (if their inſides might be

                  <p>§ Concerning <hi>the audacity of Pan; and his combate upon challenge with Cupid; the meaning of it is, that matter wants not inclination, and deſire, to the relapſing and diſſolution of the World into the old Chaos; if hir malice and violence were not restrained and kept in order, by the prepotent concord of things; ſignified by Cupid, or the God of Love.</hi> And therefore it fell out well for man, by the fatall contexture of the world; or rather the great goodneſſe of the Divine Providence, that <hi>Pan</hi> was found too weak, and overcome. To the ſame effect may be interpreted, <hi>his catching of Typhon in a net:</hi> for howſoever there may ſometimes happen vaſt, and unwonted tumors (as the name of <hi>Typhon</hi> imports) either in the Sea, or in the Ayre, or in the Earth; yet nature doth intangle in an intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate toile, and curbe and reſtraine as it were with a chaine of Adamant the exceſſes and inſolencies of theſe kind of Bodies.</p>
                  <p>§ As touching the <hi>finding out of Ceres, attributed to this God, and that as he was hunting and thought little of it,</hi> which none of the other Gods could doe, though they did nothing elſe but ſeek hir, and that with diligence; it gives us this true and grave admonition; that is, <hi>that men doe not expect the invention of things neceſſary for life and manners, from abſtract Philoſophies, as from the greater Gods; though they ſhould apply themſelves to no other ſtudy; but only from</hi> Pan, <hi>that is, from diſcreet experience, and from the univerſall obſervation of the things of the World;</hi> where oftentimes by chance (and as it were going a hunting) ſuch inventions are lighted upon.

                  <p>§ Laſtly it is not to be wondered at, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing attributed unto <hi>Pan</hi> concerning <hi>Loves,</hi> but only of the marriage with <hi>Eccho;</hi> for the world doth injoy it ſelfe, and in it ſelfe all things elſe. Now he that loves would enjoy ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but where there is enough, there is no place left to deſire. Wherefore there can be no wanton love in <hi>Pan,</hi> or the <hi>World,</hi> nor deſire to obtaine any thing, (ſeeing it is conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it ſelfe) but only <hi>Speeches;</hi> which (if plaine) are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Nymph <hi>Eccho,</hi> a thing not ſubſtantiall, but only vocall, if more accurate by <hi>Syringa;</hi> that is, when <hi>words</hi> and <hi>voices</hi> are regulate by certaine numbers; Poeticall, or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratoricall, as by muſicall meaſures. It is an excellent inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that amongſt <hi>ſpeeches,</hi> and <hi>voices,</hi> only <hi>Eccho</hi> ſhould be taken in marriage by the <hi>World; for that alone is true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, which doth faithfully render the very words of the world; and which is written, no otherwiſe, than the world doth dictate; and is nothing elſe than the image and reflection thereof;</hi> and addeth nothing of its owne, but only iterates, and reſounds.</p>

                  <p>§ <hi>This Fable</hi> ſeems to be deviſed for direction to the preparation,<note place="margin">Sandys Comment. in Ovid. Met. 4. Renovard.</note> and order that is to be obſerved in making of warre. And firſt the undertaking of any warre ought to be as a commiſsion from <hi>Pallas;</hi> certainly not from <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus,</hi> (as the Trojan warre was) or ſome ſuch ſlight motive; becauſe the Deſignes of Warre, ought to be grounded upon ſolid Counſils. Than for the choice of warre; for the nature and quality thereof; the Fable propounds three grave and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Precepts. <hi>The firſt is, that a Prince doe not much trouble himſelfe about the conquest of neighbour Nations: nor is the way of enlarging a Patrimony, and an Empiry, the ſame; for in the augmentation of private poſſiſsions, the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of Territories is to be conſidered; but in the amplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of publique Dominions, the occaſion and facility of makeing warre, and the fruit to be expected, ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of propinquity.</hi> Therefore <hi>Perſeus,</hi> though an Eaſterne Prince, makes the expedition of his warre a farre off, even in the remoteſt parts of the Weſterne World.<note place="margin">Plut. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lex. Id. de Fort. Alex.</note> 
                     <hi>There is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> preſident of this Caſe, in the different manner of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, practiſed by two Kings, the Father and the Sonne, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:150781:121"/> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> For <hi>Philip</hi> warred upon Borderers only, and added to the Empire ſome few Citties, and that not without great contention and danger; who many times, but eſpecially in a Theban warre, was brought into extreme hazard: But <hi>Alexander</hi> carried the Actions of his warre a farre off; and with a proſperous boldneſſe undertook an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition againſt the <hi>Perſian;</hi> conquered infinite Nations; tired, rather with travile, than warre. This point is farther cleered in the propagation of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> what time their conqueſts towards the Weſt ſcarce reacht beyond <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria,</hi> did yet in the <hi>East,</hi> bring all the provinces as farre as the mountaine <hi>Taurus,</hi> within the compaſſe of their Armes and command.<note place="margin">Hiſt.

Certainly warres made upon Nations farre off, have this advantage, that they are to fight with thoſe who are not practiſed in the diſcipline and Armes of the Aggreſſor: but in a warre made upon Borderers, the caſe is otherwiſe. Beſides the preparation for ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition is commonly better appointed; and the terror to the enemy from ſuch a bold and confident enterpriſe, the greater. Neither can there uſually be made, by the enimy to whom the warre is brought ſo farre off, any retaliation or reciprocall invaſion; which in a warre upon borderers often falls out. But the chief point is, that in ſubdueing a neighbour ſtate, the election of advantages is brought to a ſtraight; but in a forraigne expedition, a man may turne the race of the warre at pleaſure, thether, where military diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is moſt weakned; or the ſtrength of the Nation much waſted and worne; or Civile diſcords are ſeaſonably on foot; or ſuch like opportunities preſent themſelves.</p>

                  <p>§ <hi>In warre thoſe three guifts of the Gods doe most availe,</hi> ſo as commonly they governe, and lead fortune after them: for <hi>Perſeus received ſpeed, from Mercury;</hi> concealing <hi>of his Counſils, from Orcus; and</hi> Providence <hi>from Pallas.</hi> Neither is it without an Allegorie, and that moſt prudent, that thoſe wings of <hi>ſpeed</hi> in diſpatch of affaires (for quickneſſe in warre is of ſpeciall importance) were faſtned unto his heeles, and not unto his Arme-holes; to his feet, and not to his ſhoulders; becauſe <hi>celerity</hi> is required, not ſo much in the firſt aggreſſions and preparations; as in the purſuit and the ſucours that ſecond the firſt aſſaults: for there is no er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in warre more frequent, <hi>than that proſequution, and ſubſidiary forces, fiale to anſwer the alacrity cf the first</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.

                     <hi>Now the Helmet of Pluto,</hi> which hath power to make men inviſible, is plaine in the Morall: for the <hi>ſecreting of Counſils</hi> next to <hi>Celerity,</hi> is of great moment in warre; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Celerity it ſelfe is a great part; for <hi>ſpeed,</hi> prevents the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure of Counſils. <hi>It pertains to Pluto's Helmet,</hi> that there be one generall of the Army in warre, inveſted with abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute authority; for conſultations communicated with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, partake more of the <hi>Plumes</hi> of <hi>Mars,</hi> than of the <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Pluto.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe are various Pretenſions, and doubtfull deſignations, and emiſſary reports; which either caſt a cloud over mens eyes, or turne them another way, and place the true aimes of Counſils in the darke: for dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and diffident Cautions touching letters, Ambaſſadors, Rebells, and many ſuch like Proviſoes, adorne and begirt the <hi>Helmet</hi> of <hi>Pluto.

Hetherto belong the ſending out of eſpialls, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of camps, (which in the Military diſcipline of this latter age, is almoſt grown out of uſe: for the camps of the Romans were ſtrengthened as if it had bin a Citty, againſt all adverſe events of warre) a ſetled and well ordered Army, not truſting too much to the light Bands, or to the troops of horſemen; and whatſoever appertaines to a ſubſtantiall and adviſed Defenſive warre: ſeeing in warres the <hi>ſhield of Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> prevailes more than the <hi>ſword of Mars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ <hi>But Perſeus</hi> albeit he was ſufficiently furniſht with forces and courage, yet was he to doe one thing of ſpeciall importance, before he enterprized the Action; and that was
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:150781:122"/> to have ſome <hi>intelligence with the Greae.</hi> Theſe <hi>Greae are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> which may be termed the <hi>ſiſters of Warre;</hi> not deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the ſame ſtock, but farre unlike in nobility of Birth: <hi>ſo warres are Generous and Heroicall; but Treaſons baſe and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble.</hi> Their deſcription is elegant, for they are ſaid to be gray headed, and like old women from their birth; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Traitors are continually vext with cares and trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. But all their ſtrength, before the break out into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Rebellions, conſiſts either in an <hi>Eye; or in a Tooth;</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very faction alienated from any ſtate, hath an <hi>evill eye; and bites.</hi> Beſides, this <hi>Eye and Tooth</hi> is, as it were, common; for whatſoever they can learne or know, runs from hand to hand amongſt them. And as concerning the <hi>Tooth,</hi> they doe all bite alike, and caſt the ſame ſcandals; ſo that hear one, and you hear all. <hi>Perſeus</hi> therefore was to deale with theſe <hi>Greae,</hi> and to engage their aſſiſtance for the loan of their <hi>Eye and Tooth:</hi> their <hi>Eye for Diſcoveries;</hi> their <hi>Tooth for the ſowing and ſpreading of Rumors;</hi> and the ſtirring up of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; and the troubling of the mindes of men. <hi>After all things are well, and preparedly diſpoſed for warre;</hi> that is firſt of all to be taken into conſideration, which <hi>Perſeus</hi> did, <hi>that Meduſa may be found a ſleep:</hi> for a wiſe Captain ever aſſaults the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my unprepared; and when he is moſt ſecure. <hi>Lastly in the very action and heat of warre,</hi> the looking into <hi>Pallas Glaſſe,</hi> is to be put in practiſe: for moſt men, before it come to the puſh, can with diligence and circumſpection dive into, and diſcerne the ſtate and deſignes of the enimies; but in the very point of danger, either are amazed with fear; or in a raſh mood fronting dangers too directly, precipitate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into them; mindfull of victory; but forgetfull of eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and retrete. Yet neither of theſe ſhould be practiſed, but they ſhould look with a reverſed countenance into <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las Mirror;</hi> that ſo the ſtroak may be rightly directed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either terror or fury.</p>
                  <p>§ After the Warre was finiſht, and the victory wonne, there followed two Effects; <hi>The procreation and raiſing of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſus;</hi> which evidently denotes Fame, that flying through
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:150781:123"/> the world proclaimes victory; and makes the remaines of that warre eaſy and feaſable. <hi>The ſecond is the bearing of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa's head in his ſhield;</hi> becauſe there is no kind of defence for excellency comparable to this: For one famous and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Act proſperouſly enterpriz'd and atchieved; ſtrikes the Spirit of inſurrection in an enemy, into an amazing ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and blaſts envy hir ſelfe into an aſtoniſhment and wonder.</p>

                  <p>§ <hi>There is ſuch excellent Morality coucht in this fable,</hi> as Morall Philoſophy affords not better. <hi>For under the Perſon of Bacchus is deſcribed the nature of Paſsion; or of Affections and Perturbations of the mind. Firſt therefore touching the birth</hi> and parentage of <hi>Paſsion;</hi> the beginning of all Paſſion, though never ſo hurtfull, is nothing elſe than <hi>good Apparent:</hi> For as the Mother of virtue is <hi>good-Existent;</hi> ſo the Mother of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is <hi>good Apparent.</hi> The one of theſe (under which Perſon, the ſoule of man is repreſented) is <hi>Jupiters</hi> lawfull wife; the other his Concubine: which yet affecteth the honour of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> as <hi>Semele</hi> did. <hi>Paſsion</hi> is conceiv'd in an unlawfull deſire, raſhly granted, before rightly underſtood, and judged: And after when it begins to grow fervent, the <hi>Mother</hi> of it, which is the Nature and Species of <hi>Good,</hi> by too much inflamation is deſtroyed, and periſheth. The proceeding of <hi>Paſſion</hi> from the firſt conception thereof is after this manner: It is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht and concealed by the mind of man (which is the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of <hi>Paſſion,</hi>) ſpecially in the inferior part of the mind, as in the thigh; and ſo vexeth, and pulleth, and depreſſeth the mind; as thoſe good determinations and actions, are much hindred and lamed thereby: but when it comes to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by conſent and habit; and breakes out into Act; that it hath now, as it were fulfill'd the months, and is brought forth and born; firſt for a while it is brought up by <hi>Proſerpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi> that is, it ſeeks corners and ſecret places, and lurks as it were, underground; untill the rains of ſhame and fear laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and boldneſſe comming on; it either aſſumes the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of ſome virtue, or becomes altogether impudent and ſhameleſſe. <hi>And it is moſt true that every vehement Paſſion is of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:150781:124"/> a doubtfull ſexe;</hi> being maſculine in the firſt motion; but fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine in proſeqution. <hi>It is an excellent fiction, that of dead Bacchus, reviving;</hi> for <hi>Paſſions</hi> doe ſometimes ſeeme to be in a dead ſleepe, and extinct; but we muſt not truſt them, no though they were buried: For let there be but matter and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity offer'd, they riſe againe.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>The invention of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine is a wiſe Parable;</hi> for every affection is very quick and witty in finding out that which nouriſheth, and cheriſheth it; and of all things knowne to men, <hi>wine is moſt powerfull and efficacious to excite and inflame Paſſions; of what kind ſoever;</hi> as being in a ſort a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centive to them all.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Againe Affection or Paſſion is elegantly ſet downe to be a ſubduer of Nations, and an undertaker tf infinite expeditions:</hi> For <hi>deſire</hi> never reſts content with what it poſſeſſeth; but with an infinite and unſatiable appetite ſtill covets more; &amp; hearkens after a new purchaſe.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>So Tygers</hi> STABLE <hi>by Affections; and draw their Chariot:</hi> For ſince the time that <hi>Affection</hi> began to ride in a Coach; and to goe no more a foot; and to captivate <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and to lead hir away in triumph; it grows cruel; unmanegeable, and fierce, againſt whatſoever withſtands or oppoſeth it.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>And it is a pretty deviſe, that thoſe ridiculous Demons, are brought in dancing about Bacchus Chariot:</hi> For every vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment affection doth cauſe in the eyes; face; and geſture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent and ſubſeeming, apeiſh, and deformed motions; ſo that they who in any kind of Paſſiion, (as in anger; arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance; or love) ſeem glorious and brave in their owne eyes; doe appeare to others miſhapen, and ridiculous.</p>

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:150781:124"/> on hir that was abandoned and reiected by another:</hi> it is an Allegory of ſpeciall regard; for it is moſt certain, that <hi>Paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ever ſeekes and ſues for that which experience hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſht, and they all know, who have paid deare for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and obaying their <hi>Luſts;</hi> that whether it be honor; or riches; or delight; or glory; or knowledge; or any thing elſe, which they ſeeke after; they purſue things caſt off, and by diverſe men in all ages after experience had utterly rejected and repudiate.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Neither is it without a Myſtery, that the Jvy was ſacred to Bacchus,</hi> the application holds two waies: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that the <hi>Ivy</hi> remaines green in Winter; <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that it creeps along, imbraceth, and advanceth it ſelfe over ſo many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe bodies, as trees, walls, and edifices. <hi>Touching the first,</hi> every <hi>Paſsion</hi> doth through renitence and prohibition, and as it were, by an <hi>Anti-periſtaſis,</hi> (like the <hi>Ivy</hi> through the cold of winter) grow freſh and lively. <hi>Secondly,</hi> every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant affection in mans ſoule, like the <hi>Ivy,</hi> doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe and confine all human Actions and Conſils; neither can you finde any thing ſo immaculate and inconcern'd, which affections have not tainted and clinched as it were with their tendrells.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Neither is it a wonder, that ſuperſtitious ceremonies were attributed unto Bacchus,</hi> ſeeing every giddy-headed humor keeps, in a manner, Revell-rout in falſe Religions; ſo that the pollutions and diſtempers of heretiques, exceed the Bachanalls of the Heathens; and whoſe ſuperſtitions have bin no leſſe barbarous; than vile and loathſome. <hi>Nor is it a wonder that Madneſſe is thought to be ſent by Bacchus,</hi> ſeeing every affection in the Exceſſe thereof, is a kind of <hi>ſhort fury;</hi> and if it grow vehement and become habituall; it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concludes in <hi>Madneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Concerning the rending and diſmembring of Pentheus and Orpheus, in the celebration of the Orgies of Bacchus;</hi> the Parable is plain. For every <hi>prevalent affection</hi> is outragious againſt two things; <hi>whereof the one is Curious enquiry into it; the other free and wholſome admonition.</hi> Nor will it availe, though that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:150781:125"/> 
                     <hi>inquiry</hi> was only to contemplate and to behold, as it were going up into a tree, without any malignity of mind; nor againe, though that <hi>admonition</hi> was given with much art and ſweetneſſe, but howſoever, the <hi>Orgies</hi> of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> can not endure either <hi>Pentheus</hi> or <hi>Orpheus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Laſtly that confuſion of the Perſons of Iupiter and Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> may be well transferred to a Parable; ſeeing noble and famous Acts, and remarkable and glorious merits, doe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times proceed from virtue and well ordered reaſon, and magnanimity; and ſometimes from a ſecret affection, and a hidden paſsion; howſoever both the one and the other, ſo affect the renowne of Fame, and Glory; that a man can hardly diſtinguiſh between the Acts of <hi>Bacchus;</hi> and the Geſts of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                  </p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>Knowledge is like waters; ſome waters deſcend from the Heavens, ſome ſpring from the Earth;</hi> ſo the Primary <hi>Partition</hi> of Sciences, is to be derived from their fountaines, ſome are ſeated above; ſome are heere beneath. For all knowledge
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150781:126"/> proceeds from a two fold information; <hi>either from Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or from externall Sence;</hi> As for that knowledge which is infuſed by inſtruction; that is Cumulative, not O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall; as it is in waters, which beſides the Head-ſprings, are encreaſed by the reception of other Rivers that fall into them. <hi>Wherefore we will divide Sciences, into Theology; and Philoſophy;</hi> by <hi>Theology</hi> we underſtand <hi>Jnſpired or Sacred Divinity;</hi> not Naturall, of which we are to ſpeak anon. But this <hi>Inſpired Theology,</hi> we reſerve for the laſt place, that we may cloſe up this work with it; ſeeing it is the Port and Saboath of all Humane Contemplations.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Obiect of Philoſophy is of three ſorts;</hi> GOD; NA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE; MAN: ſo likewiſe there is a Triple <hi>Beam</hi> of Things; <hi>for Nature darts upon the underſtanding with a direct</hi> Beame; <hi>God becauſe of the inequality of the mediu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is the Creature, with a refract beame; and man repreſented and exhibited to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, with a beam reflext.</hi> Wherefore Philoſophy may fitly be divided into three knowledges; the <hi>knowledge of God;</hi> the <hi>knowledge of Nature;</hi> and the <hi>knowledge of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. And becauſe the Partition of Sciences are not like ſeverall lines that meet in one angle; but rather like bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of trees that meet in one ſtemme, which ſtemme for ſome dimenſion and ſpace is entire and continued, before it break, and part it ſelfe into armes and boughes; therefore the nature of the ſubject requires, before we purſue the parts of the former diſtribution, to erect and conſtitute <hi>one univerſall Science,</hi> which may be the mother of the reſt; and that in the progreſſe of Sciences, a Portion, as it were, of the common high-way may be kept, before we come where the waies part and divide themſelves. <hi>This Science we ſtile Primitive Philoſophy or Sapience,</hi> which by the Ancients was defin'd to be, <hi>The Science of things divine and human.</hi> To this <hi>Science</hi> none of the reſt is oppoſed, being it is differenced from other knowledges, rather in the limits of latitude; than in the things and ſubject; that is, handleing only the tops of things.<note place="margin">✿</note> Whether I ſhould report this as DEFICIENT, I ſtand doubtfull, yet I think I very well may. For I find a
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150781:126"/> certain kind of Rhapſody, and confuſed maſſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, namely of <hi>Naturall Theology;</hi> of <hi>Logique;</hi> of particular parts of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy</hi> (as of the Principles of Nature, and of the ſoule) compoſited and compiled; and by the height of termes (from men who love to admire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) advanced, and exalted, as it were, to the verticall point of Sciences. But we, without any ſuch ſtately lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, would only have thus much, <hi>That there might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd a certain Science that ſhould be the receptacle of all ſuch Axioms, as fall not within the compaſſe of any ſpeciall part of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy; but are more common to them all, or most of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ That there are many of this kind needs not to be doubted. For example, <hi>Si inaequalibus aequalia addas;</hi>

                  <hi>omnia e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt inaequalia;</hi> is a rule in the Mathematiques: and the ſame holds in the Ethiques concerning <hi>Attributive Iuſtice;</hi> for in <hi>Iuſtice Expletive,</hi> the reaſon of equitie requires, <hi>That equall Portion be given to unequall Perſons; but in Attributive, unleſſe unequall be diſtributed unto unequall, it is a great injustice.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Avicenna Hippoc.

And indeed the Perſian Magique, ſo much celebrated, conſiſts chiefly in this; <hi>to obſerve the reſpondency in the Architectures, and Fabriques of things Natural; &amp; of things Civile.</hi> Neither are all theſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have ſpoken, and others of like nature <hi>meere Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> only, as men of narrow obſervation perchance may conceive; but one and the very ſame footſteps, and ſeales of Nature, printed upon ſeverall ſubjects or matters. <hi>This kind of Science,</hi> hath not bin hither too ſeriouſly handled: You may peradventure find in the Writings comming from the pens of the profounder ſort of wits, Axiomes of this kind, thinly and ſparſedly inſerted, for the uſe and explication of the Argument which they have in hand; but a complete bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>of ſuch Maximes, which have a Primitive and Summary force and efficacy in all Sciences, none yet have compoſed;</hi> being not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a matter of ſuch conſequence, as doth notably conduce to the unity of Nature; which we conceive to be the office and uſe of <hi>Philoſophia Prima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ There is alſo an other Part of this, <hi>Primitive Ppiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> which, if you reſpect <hi>termes,</hi> is Ancient; but, if the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> which we deſigne, is new, and of an other kind; and it is an Inquiry concerning the <hi>Acceſſory Conditions</hi> of <hi>Entities,</hi> which we may call <hi>Tranſcendents;</hi> as <hi>Multitude, Paucity; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude; Diverſity; Poſsible,</hi> and <hi>Jmpoſsible; Entity; Non-Entity;</hi> and the like. For being <hi>Tranſcendents</hi> doe not properly fall within the compaſſe of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy;</hi> and that Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall diſſertation about them is rather accommodated to the Formes of Argumentation; than the Nature of things; it is very convenient that this Contemplation, wherein there is ſo much dignity and profit, ſhould not be altogither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted; but find at leaſt ſome roome in the <hi>Partitions of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:</hi>

               <p>We may returne to the former Diviſion of the three Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophies, <hi>Divine; Naturall; and Humane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I <hi>For Naturall Theology,</hi> is truly called <hi>Divine Philoſophy.</hi> And this is defined to be a Knowledge, or rather a ſpark and rudiment of that Knowledge concerning God; ſuch as may be had by the light of Nature; and the Contemplation of the Creature: which Knowledge may be truly termed <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> in reſpect of the Object; and <hi>Naturall</hi> in reſpect of the Light. The Bounds of this Knowledge are truly ſet forth, that they may extend to the Confutation and Conviction of Atheiſme; the Information of the Law of Nature; but may not be drawne out to the Confirmation of Religion. <hi>Therefore there was never Miracle wrought by God to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert an Atheiſt, becauſe the light of Nature might have led him to confeſſe a God; but Miracles are deſigned to convert Idolaters, and the Superſtitious, who have acknowledged a Deity, but erred in his Adoration; becauſe no light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture extends to declare the will and true Worſhip of God.</hi> For as workes doe ſhew forth the power and skill of the workman, but not his Image: So the workes of God, doe ſhew the Omnipotency and Wiſdome of the Maker; but no way expreſſe his Jmage. And in this the Heathen opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on differs from the ſacred Truth. For they defined the world to be the Image of God; man the Image of the World; but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures never vouchſafed the world that honour, as any where to be ſtiled the Jmage of God, but only,<note place="margin">Pſal. 8.

                  <hi>That Men and Gods were not able to draw Iupiter down to the Earth; but contrariwiſe Iupiter was able to draw them up to Heaven.</hi> Wherefore he laboureth in vaine, who ſhall attempt to draw downe heavenly Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to our reaſon; it rather becomes us to raiſe and advance our reaſon to the adored Throne of Divine Truth, <hi>And in this part of Naturall Theology,</hi> I am ſo farre from noteing any deficience, as I rather finde an exceſſe; which to obſerve I have ſomewhat digreſſed, becauſe of the extreme prejudice, which both Religion and Philoſophy have received there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; as that which will faſhion and forge a hereticall Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and an imaginary and fabulous Philoſophy.</p>

               <p>§ To returne therefore to the acception of the word <hi>Metaphyſique,</hi> in our ſence. It appears by that which hath bin already ſaid, that we diſtinguiſh <hi>Primitive Philoſophy,</hi> from <hi>Metaphyſique,</hi> which heretofore hath bin confounded and taken for the ſame thing. The one we have ſet downe as a <hi>commune Parent of all Sciences;</hi> the other, as a portion of <hi>Naturall Philoſophy.</hi> We have aſsign'd Common and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous <hi>Axioms</hi> of Sciences, to <hi>Primitive Philoſophy.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe all <hi>Relative and Adventive condicions and Characters of Eſſences,</hi> which we have named <hi>Tranſcendents;</hi> as <hi>Multitude, Paucity, Jdentity, Diverſity, Poſsible Jmpoſsible,</hi> and ſuch like; we have attributed to the ſame, only with this Proviſo, that they be handled as they have efficacy in nature; and not Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically. <hi>But we have referred</hi> the inquiry concerning <hi>God; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Bonity, Angels, Spirits,</hi> to <hi>Naturall Theology.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now it may rightly be demanded, what after all this is remaining to <hi>Metaphyſique!</hi> certainly beyond nature, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but of nature it ſelfe the moſt excellent part. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without prejudice to Truth, we may thus farre con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the opinion and conceipt of Antiquity; that <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique</hi> only handleth that which is inherent in matter, and is moveable; <hi>Metaphyſique</hi> things more abſtracted and fixt. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that Phyſique</hi> ſuppoſeth exiſtence only and Motion; and naturall Neceſsity: but <hi>Metaphyſique</hi> the Mind alſo; the Idea or platforme. For to this point perchance the matter comes, whereof we ſhall diſcourſe. But we will propound this difference, (leaving aſide the ſublimity of ſpeech) perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly and familiarly. We have divided <hi>Naturall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> into the Inquiſition of cauſes; and the production of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The inquiry of cauſes we have referred to the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall part of <hi>Philoſophy;</hi> which we have divided into <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique and Metaphyſique:</hi> wherefore by neceſſary conſequence the true difference of theſe two Theoryes, muſt be taken from the nature of the Cauſes which they enquire; ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all obſcurity or circuit, <hi>Phyſique</hi> is that which enquires of the <hi>efficient cauſe;</hi> and of the <hi>Matter; Metaphyſique,</hi> that which enquires of the <hi>Forme and end.</hi>

               <p>Fire is cauſe of induration, but reſpective to clay; Fire is cauſe of colliquation, but reſpective to waxe. We will divide <hi>Phiſique</hi> into three Knowledges: For Nature is either uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and collected into one; or diffuſed and diſtributed: Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is collected into one either in reſpect of the <hi>common Seeds and Principles of all things;</hi> or in reſpect of the <hi>entire, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Fabrique of the univerſe.</hi> This union of Nature hath brought forth two Parts of <hi>Phyſique,</hi> one of the <hi>Principles of Things;</hi> the other of the <hi>Fabrique of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> or of the World; which we uſe to call the Doctrines of <hi>Summes</hi> or <hi>Totalls. The third Knowledge</hi> which handles Nature <hi>diffuſed,</hi> or <hi>ſcattered,</hi> exhibites <hi>all the variety of things,</hi> &amp; the leſſer <hi>Summes</hi> or <hi>Totalls.</hi> Wherefore from theſe contemplations it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manifeſt, that there are three Knowledges touching <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Philoſophy, of the Principles of things; of the world; or of the Fabrique of thing.</hi> Of Nature <hi>multiplicious or ſparſed;</hi> which laſt Part, (as we have ſaid) containes all the variety of things; and is, as it were; the firſt Gloſſe, or Paraphaſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the INTERPRETATION OF NATVRE Of theſe three Parts, none is wholly DEFICIENT; but in what truth and Perfection they are handled, I make not now my judgment.</p>
               <p n="3">III But we will again divide <hi>Phyſique distinctively ſorted,</hi> or of the <hi>variety of things,</hi> into two Parts; <hi>into Phyſique of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets; and into Phyſique of Abſtracts: or into Phyſique of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> and into Phyſique of <hi>Natures.</hi> The one (to uſe the termes of Logique) inquires of <hi>Subſtances</hi> with all the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their Adjuncts; the other of <hi>Accidents,</hi> or Adjuncts through all the variety of ſubſtances. <hi>For example,</hi> if the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry be of a <hi>Lion,</hi> or of an <hi>Oak,</hi> theſe are ſupported by many and diverſe Accidents: Contrariwiſe if the inquiry be made of <hi>Heate, or Heavineſſe,</hi> theſe are in many diſtinct ſubſtances.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:150781:132"/> And ſeeing all <hi>Phyſique or Naturall Philoſophy</hi> is ſituate in a midle terme, betweene <hi>Naturall Hiſtory and Metaphyſique;</hi> the firſt part (if you obſerve it well) comes neerer to <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Hiſtory;</hi> the later part neerer to <hi>Metaphyſique; Concret Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique</hi> hath the ſame diviſion which <hi>Naturall Hiſtory</hi> hath; ſo that it is a knowledge either concerning the <hi>Heavens;</hi> or concerning <hi>Meteors;</hi> or concerning the <hi>Globe of the earth and Sea;</hi> or concerning the <hi>greater Collegiates,</hi> which they call the <hi>Elements;</hi> or concerning the <hi>leſſer Collegiates, or natures ſpecifique;</hi> ſo likewiſe concerning <hi>Pretergenerations;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Mechaniques.</hi> For in all theſe <hi>Naturall Hiſtory</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and reports the fact it ſelfe; but <hi>Phyſique,</hi> the Cauſes likewiſe; but you muſt conceive this of fluid, not fixt Cauſes, that is, of matter and of the efficient.</p>
               <p>§ Amongſt theſe Portions of <hi>Phyſique, that Part is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether maimed and imperfect which enquires of Coeleſtiall bodies;</hi> which notwithſtanding, for the excellency of the Subject, ought to be taken into ſpeciall conſideration: For <hi>Astronomy</hi> it is indeed not without ſome probability and uſe grounded upon the <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> but it is vulgar; baſe, and no way ſolid: But <hi>Astrology</hi> in many Circumſtances hath no ground at all. <hi>Jn truth Astronomy</hi> preſents ſuch a ſacrifice to Mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as once <hi>Prometheus</hi> did, when he went about to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Jupiter;</hi> for inſtead of a true, ſubſtantiall <hi>Oxe,</hi> he preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>hide</hi> of a great and faire <hi>Oxe</hi> ſtuft, and ſet out with ſtraw, leaves, and Oſier twigs; ſo in like manner <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> exhibiteth the extrinſique Parts of Celeſtiall Bodies, (namely the Number, Situation, Motion, and Periods of the ſtarres) as the <hi>Hide of Heaven;</hi> faire and artificially contrived into Syſtemes, and Schemes: but the Entrals are wanting, that is, <hi>Phyſicall reaſons,</hi> out of which (adjoyning Aſtronomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Hypotheſes) the Theory ſhould be extracted, not ſuch grounds and ſuppoſitions as ſhould only ſave the <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> (of which kind a number may be wittily deviſed) but ſuch as propound the ſubſtance, motion and influxe of the Heavens, as they they truly are in nature.

And that we may a litle more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider the matter.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Firſt what a vaine fancy is this, that every Planet ſhould raigne for certain houres by turne, ſo as in the ſpace of twentyfoure howers, they ſhould reſume their Dominions thrice over, three ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:150781:134"/> howers reſerved?</hi> Yet this conceit brought forth unto us the Diviſion of the week; a computation very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and generally received, as from the interchangeable courſe of daies moſt manifeſtly it appears; when in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the day immediatly ſucceeding, the fourth Planet from the Planet of the firſt day, enters upon his Goverment; by reaſon of the three ſupernumerary howres, whereof we have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Again we are confident to reject, as an idle fiction, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Genethliacall Poſitures of the heavens, to preciſe points of time; with the Distribution of the Howſes;</hi> thoſe ſame darlings in Aſtrologie, which have made ſuch madde work in the Heavens; nor can I ſufficiently wonder that many excellent men, and for Aſtrology of Principall note, ſhould ground themſelves upon ſo ſlight reaſons, to avouch ſuch opinions. For they ſay, ſeeing that experience it ſelfe diſcovers as much, that <hi>Solſtices, Aequinoctialls, new Moone, full Moones,</hi> and the like <hi>greater revolutions</hi> of ſtarres, doe manifeſtly and notably work upon naturall Bodies; it muſt needs be, that the more exact, and ſubtile aſpect and poſture of the ſtarres, ſhould produce effects more exquiſite and occult. But they ſhould firſt except the Sunnes operations by manifeſt heat; and likewiſe, the magnetique influence of the Moone, upon the <hi>increaſe of Tides every halfe Moone</hi> (for the daily Fluxe and Refluxe of the Sea, is another thing.) But theſe ſet aſide; the other powers of the Planets upon naturall bodies (ſo farre as they are confirmed by experience) is ſlender and weak; and, which they ſhall finde, latent in the <hi>greater Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions.</hi> Wherefore they ſhould rather argue the other way, namely, that ſeeing thoſe <hi>greater Revolutions,</hi> have ſo ſmall influence, <hi>thoſe exact and minute differences of Poſitures</hi> have no force at all.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Thirdly, Thoſe Fatalities, that the hower of Nativity or conception governs the Birth; The hower of inception, the fortune of the thing begunne; the hower of Queſtion, the fortune of the thing enquired; and, in a word, the ſcience of Nativities, Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Queſtions, and ſuch like levities; in our judgement, have no
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:150781:134"/> certainty or ſolidity in them; and may by naturall reaſons be plainly redargued and evinced.</hi> The point to be ſpoken of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is, what that is which we retaine and allow of in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologie; and in that which we doe allow, what is defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? for, for this end, that is, for the obſervation of <hi>Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,</hi> we undertook this work; not intending (as we have often ſaid) matter of cenſure. And indeed amongſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd parts of <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> the Doctrines of <hi>Revolutions</hi> wee judge to have more ſoundneſſe in them, than the reſt. But it may be to good purpoſe, to ſet downe and preſcribe certain Rules, by the ſcale and ſquare whereof, <hi>Aſtrologicall</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations may be examined; that what is fruitfull may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd; what is frivolous rejected.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The firſt Precept</hi> may be that whereof we have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſht already; <hi>let the greater Revolutions be retained; the leſſer Horoſcopes and Howſes caſſeer'd.</hi> Thoſe like Great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance may diſcharge their influences, at a ſpacious remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; theſe like ſmall Bowes, are for a ſhort diſtance, and carry not their forces farre. <hi>The ſecond rule is; That the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Heavens workes not on all bodies) but only upon the more tender and penetrable;</hi> ſuch as are Humors, Aer, Spirits: but here we except the Operations <hi>of the heate of the Sun, and of the Heavens,</hi> which without queſtion pierce even to Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and many ſubterraneous Bodies. <hi>The third rule is, that the Operation of the Heavens extends rather to the Maſſe of things and Nature in groſſe; than unto individuall eſſences, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities;</hi> yet obliquely it reacheth to many Individualls, namely, thoſe Individuates which of the ſame ſpecies are moſt <hi>Paſsible,</hi> and are like ſoft waxe: even as when a Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall aire ſeizeth on bodies more open and leſſe reſiſtent; and paſſeth by Bodies more compact and ſtrong. <hi>The fourth rule is,</hi> ſomewhat like the precedent; <hi>That the Operation of the Heavens hath its influxe and dominion not in points and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row minutes of times; but in greater ſpaces.</hi> Therefore <hi>Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtications</hi> of the temperatures of the yeare may be true; but upon particular daies, are worthily accounted vaine and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. <hi>The laſt rule,</hi> (which by the more wiſe Aſtrologers hath
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:150781:135"/> bin ever imbraced) is, <hi>That there is no fatall neceſſity in the starres, but that they doe incline rather, than enforce.</hi> Wee adde this moreover (wherein we plainly take part with <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> if it were rectified) and which we know to be moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: <hi>That Celeſtiall bodies have other influences beſides heate and light:</hi> which influences are of force according to the Rules we have preſcribed, and no otherwiſe: But theſe lie hidde in the profound Parts of Naturall Philoſophy, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a larger diſſertation. Wherefore we think good (that which we have ſaid being rightly conceived) to ſet downe, <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> agreeable to our Principles,<note place="margin">✿</note> amongſt DEFICI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENTS, and as we have named <hi>Aſtronomie</hi> grounded upon naturall reaſons, <hi>Living Aſtronomie,</hi> ſo we think fit to call <hi>Aſtrologie</hi> aſcertain'd upon the ſame reaſons, <hi>Sound Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</hi> As for the right way how to frame and make this Art, although what we have ſaid, doth not a litle conduce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, yet according to our manner, we will adde a few more obſervations which ſhall cleerly propound, out of what materialls it ſhould be collected, and to what end it ſhould be referred.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Firſt, let the knowledge touching the Commixtures of Beames be receiv'd into ſound Aſtrologie,</hi> that is of Conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of Opoſitions, and the reſt of the conſtellations, or Aſpects of Planets, one on an other. <hi>Alſo we aſſigne</hi> to this part concerning the Commixtures of Beams, the paſſing of the Planets through the ſignes of the Zodiaque, and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the ſame ſignes: For the location of a Planet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſigne, is a kind of Conjunction of the ſame Planet with the Starres of the ſignes: Moreover as Conjunctions, ſo likewiſe Oppoſitions and other Conſtellations of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets towards the Starres of the ſignes, are to be noted, which hitherto hath not perfectly bin accompliſht. <hi>But the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Commixtures</hi> of the Rayes of the ſixt ſtarres, are indeed profitable to the Contemplation of the Fabrique of the world; and of the Nature of the <hi>Regions</hi> lying under them; but not unto <hi>Predictions,</hi> becauſe theſe Aſpects are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:150781:135"/>
               <p>§ <hi>Secondly, let there be taken into Aſtrologie the acceſſions of every particular Planet neerer to the Perpendicular, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions from it according to the Climates of Regions.</hi> For all the Planets as well as the Sun, have their ſummers, their win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; wherein they dart downe more forcible, or more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rayes, according to their poſture in reſpect of the <hi>Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular.</hi> For without queſtion, <hi>the Moone in Leo</hi> works more forcibly upon naturall bodies here below, than when ſhe is in <hi>Piſces:</hi> Not becauſe the <hi>Moone</hi> placed in <hi>Leo,</hi> hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Heart, and under <hi>Piſces</hi> reſpects the Feet, (as the vulgar Fable goes); for their Elevation towards the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular and Approximation towards the greater ſtarres, juſt after the ſame manner as the <hi>Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Thirdly, let the Apogaea, and Perigaea of the Planets be received with due inquiry, to what the vigor of a Planet apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in reſpect of himſelfe; and to what in his vicinity to us.</hi> For a Planet in his <hi>Apogaea,</hi> or exaltation is more cheerfull, and active; but in his <hi>Perigaea</hi> or declenſion more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municative. <q>
                     <hi>So the Sun</hi> in his Elevation when hee enters the Tropick of Cancer is in heate more recollected and vigorous;<note place="margin">Interpret. additamt.</note> but when he falls off from the Meridian, as in Capricorne, hee is more faint, yet more diſperſed in his influence. For in his Aſcenſion, he is not only neerer to the fixed ſtarres; but his beams then falling at more equall and right angles; become more united; and by a direct reſultance from the earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixe, and ſo reduplicate their force; whereas in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion, they are oblique, &amp; therefore feeble and errant in reflection. Wherefore with the Inhabitants under the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, the heat is more intenſe; than it is with Northern Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finers, where the Sun daily keeps his circuit neer about the Horizon: But yet in this Perigean motion, the Suns beams are more communicative, though leſſe active; becauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the point of their incidence in the rebound, their reflection is oblique and diſperſed. This enquiry tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the projection of beames in a right or oblique line, would be made with diligence, for it concernes all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the heavens upon terrene bodies; the generall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:150781:136"/> conſtitution of the yeare; the diverſe temperatures of the aire in the five Zones; the complexion of different Climates and the like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ Fourthly to be briefe, <hi>let there be taken in all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Accidents of the motion of Planets; as what are the Accelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Retardations, Progreſſes, Stations, Retrogradations,</hi> of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them in their courſe, what their diſtance from the <hi>Sunne,</hi> their <hi>Combustions, Encreaſe,</hi> and <hi>Diminutions of Light, Ecclipſes,</hi> and whatſoever elſe of this nature? For all theſe cauſe, that the <hi>Beames</hi> of the <hi>Planets</hi> doe work more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or more weakly, and after diverſe waies and diſtinct virtues; And theſe foure obſervations, belong to the Radia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſtarres.</p>
               <p>§ Fiftly, let there be received in, whatſoever may any way, open and diſcloſe the natures of ſtarres <hi>Errant</hi> or <hi>Fixt,</hi> in their proper eſſence and activity; as what is their <hi>Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;</hi> of what <hi>collour</hi> and <hi>aſpect;</hi> what <hi>Scintillation</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration</hi> of light; what <hi>Situation</hi> towards the <hi>Poles</hi> or <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall;</hi> what <hi>Aſteriſmes;</hi> which are more <hi>mingled</hi> with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtarres; which are more <hi>ſolitarie;</hi> which are <hi>ſuperior,</hi> which <hi>inferior;</hi> which of the fixt ſtarres are within the lines and courſe of the Sunne and Planets (namely within the Zodiaque) which without; which of the Planets is <hi>more ſwift;</hi> which <hi>more ſlow;</hi> which may <hi>move in the Eccliptique line;</hi> which may <hi>expatiate in latitude</hi> from it; what Planet may be <hi>retrograde, which not;</hi> what Planet may be at any diſtance from the Sunne, which is tied to attend the Sunne; which moves ſwifter in <hi>Apogéo,</hi> which in <hi>Perigéo;</hi> to conclude the Irregularities of <hi>Mars;</hi> the expatiations of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus;</hi> the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Labours or Paſsions, which are often found in the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and in <hi>Venus,</hi> and the like?</p>
               <p>§ Laſt of all, let there be taken into <hi>Astrologie,</hi> even from tradition the Particular Natures, and Inclination of Planets, as alſo of fixt ſtarres; which ſeeing they are delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over with ſuch an univerſall conſent; they are not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be rejected; but where they croſſe the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of naturall Principles. And of ſuch obſervations as
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:150781:136"/> theſe, <hi>ſound Aſtrologie</hi> is compiled; and according to theſe only, ſhould the Schemes and configurations of Heaven, be compoſed and interpreted. <hi>Sound Aſtrologie</hi> is likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and referred with more confidence to <hi>Predictions;</hi> to <hi>Elections;</hi> with more <hi>Caution,</hi> within due limits to both, <hi>Predictions</hi> may be made of future <hi>Comets,</hi> which as we conjecture may be foretold; and of all ſorts of Meteors; of Deluges, Draughts; Heates; Conglaciations; Earth-quakes; ore flowing of waters; breaking out of Fires; Windes; great Raines; divers Tempeſts; and ſtrange ſeaſons of the Yeare; Peſtilences, Epidemicall diſeaſes; Plenty, and dearth of Graine; Warres, Seditions, Sects, Plantations of new Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; laſtly of all commotions and greater Innovations, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Nature,</hi> or in <hi>State-Goverment:</hi> ſo theſe predictions may be drawn downe (though not with like certainty) to more <hi>ſpeciall occurrences,</hi> and perchance to <hi>ſingularities;</hi> if the generall inclinations of ſuch times and ſeaſons, being firſt diſcovered and found out, theſe be applied by a ſharpe pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing judgement Philoſophicall or Politicall, to ſpeciall or more particular events, which may be moſt ſubject to ſuch <hi>Accidents.</hi> As for example, a man ſhall find out from a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the ſeaſons of the yeare, ſuch temperatures of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as are propitious or pernitious rather to Olives, than to Vines; rather to <hi>Phthiſiques,</hi> and ulcerations of the Longues, than to <hi>Hepatiques</hi> and obſtructions of the liver; more to the inhabitants of high and montainous; than low and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pane Countries; more to Monkes, than Courtiers, by reaſon of their different kind of diet. Or if one from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he hath of the influence, the Heavens have over the ſpirits of men, ſhould find out a man to be of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion and diſpoſition; to affect or diſtaſt rather the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then Princes; rather learned and curious, than couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and warlike diſpoſitions; rather ſenſuall and voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, than active and politique natures. Such inſtances as theſe are infinite, but (as we have ſaid) they require not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that generall knowledge, taken from the ſtarres, which are Active; but alſo a particular knowledge of Subjects which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:150781:137"/> are Paſsive. Nor are <hi>Elections</hi> altogether to be rejected but more ſparingly to be credited, than <hi>Predictions.</hi> For we ſee in Planting and in Sowing and in Grafting, that the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>age</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> is a matter, not altogether vaine and frivolous. But theſe <hi>Elections,</hi> are by our rules more reſtrained than <hi>Predictions:</hi> and this muſt ever be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <hi>Elections</hi> are of force, in ſuch caſes alone, where both the <hi>Jnfluxe</hi> of the Heavens is ſuch, as doth not ſodainly paſſe over; and likewiſe the <hi>Action</hi> of <hi>Jnferiour Bodies</hi> ſuch, as is not preſently perfected: for neither the <hi>Encreaſes</hi> of the <hi>Moone,</hi> nor of the Planets are accompliſht in an inſtant: but <hi>Punctuality</hi> of time, is by all means to be rejected. There are found many of the like preciſe obſervations (which a man would hardly believe) in <hi>Elections</hi> about Civile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires. But if any man in this caſe ſhall except againſt us, ſaying, that we have indeed made ſome remonſtrance out of what this <hi>reformed Aſtrologie</hi> ſhould be deduced; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to what it may with profit be referred: but the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it is to be deduced, we have given no precept at all; he ſhould not deale equally with us, to exact at our hands the Art it ſelfe, which we never promiſed, nor pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to handle. Yet notwithſtanding touching ſuch a point of Demand, thus much we will admoniſh; that there are only foure means, which may prepare the way to this knowledge. <hi>Firſt by Experiments future; then by Experiments past;</hi> againe <hi>by Tradition;</hi> laſt of all <hi>by naturall Reaſons. Now for future Experiments,</hi> to what end ſhould we ſpeak much of them? ſeeing to make up a competent number of Jnſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo many ages are requiſite, as it were, but loſt labour, to think to comprehend it? <hi>As for Experiments paſt,</hi> they indeed are within the compaſſe and reach of men, although it is a matter will require much labour, and much leaſure to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh. For <hi>Aſtrologians</hi> (if they be not wanting to their Profeſsion) may make a collection from the faithfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of Hiſtory, of all greater contingences; as <hi>Inundations, Peſtilences, Warres; Seditions;</hi> and (if the ſtate ſo require) <hi>the deaths of Kings:</hi> and may contemplate the <hi>ſituation of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:150781:137"/> Heavens,</hi> not according to the ſubtletie of <hi>Figures;</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe generall rules which we have already ſet downe; to know in what poſtures the Heavens were, at thoſe times, when ſuch effects came to paſſe; that ſo were there is a cleere, and evident conſent, and concurrence of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; there a probable rule of <hi>Prediction</hi> may be inferred. <hi>As for Traditions,</hi> they ought to be ſo examined and ſifted, that ſuch as manifeſtly oppugne <hi>Phyſicall Reaſons,</hi> ſhould be diſcarded; but ſuch as well conſent, ſhould be valide even of their own authority. <hi>Laſtly, as for Phyſicall or Naturall reaſons,</hi> they are the apteſt for this inquiry; which make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of the Catholique and more univerſall inclinations and Paſsions of Matter; and of the ſimple and genuine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Bodies; for by theſe wings we ſafely ſoare and mount up to thoſe celeſtiall materiate ſubſtances. Thus much concerning <hi>Aſtrologia ſana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>There is another Portion of Aſtrologicall Frenzie</hi> (beſides thoſe figme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which we have noted at the begining) which is wont to be ſeperate from <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi> and to be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into <hi>Celeſtiall Magique,</hi> as they call it. This hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſtrange Gloſſe, from the working fanſie of mans wit; namely <hi>That a benevolent ſituation or Aſpect of ſtarres,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">C. Agrip. de Occult. Ph. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>may be taken in ſeales and ſignet-rings (be it of Mettalls or of any Gemme, capable of ſuch impreſsion) which may arreſt the felicity of that hower, which otherwiſe would ſwiftly paſſe away, and as it were, fixe it, being volatilous.</hi> As the Poet paſsionately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of this ſo noble Art, among the Ancients, now long agoe buried in oblivion.</p>

               </q>
               <p>Indeed the Church of Rome hath imbraced the <hi>Reliques of Saints,</hi> and their virtues, (for in Divine and immateriate things, the fluxe of time hath no power to abate the force and efficacy,) but that the <hi>Reliques of Heaven</hi> ſhould be ſo lodged, as that the hower which is paſt, and, as it were, dead, ſhould revive and be continued; is a meere ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:150781:138"/> and impoſture. Wherefore let us let goe theſe idle fancies unleſſe the Muſes be grown doting old wives.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Abſtract Phyſique in our judgement, may very well be divided into two Parts, into the Doctrine of the Schemes of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and into the doctrine of Appetites or Motions.</hi> We will runne them both over briefly, from whence the delineati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the true Phyſique of Abſtracts may be drawen. The <hi>Schemes of Matter</hi> are; <hi>Denſe, Rare; Grave, Light; Hot, Cold; Tangible, Pneumatique; Volatile, Fixt; Determinate, Fluid; Humid, Drie; Fat, Crude; Hard, Soft; Fragile, Tenſile; Porous, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited; Spirituous, Languid; Simple, Compoſite; Abſolute, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly Mixt; Fibrous and full of veines, of a ſimple Poſiture or equall; Similare Diſsimilare; Specificate Non-ſpecificate; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall Jnorganicall; Animate Jnanimate.</hi> Neither doe we extend the figurations of Matter any farther, for <hi>Senſible and Inſenſible; Rationall and Irrationall,</hi> we referre to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Man.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Appetites and Motions,</hi> are of two ſorts; either <hi>motions ſimple,</hi> which containe in them the Roots of all naturall Actions; but yet according to the <hi>Schemes and habitudes of Matter:</hi> or <hi>Motions compoſited and Producted;</hi> from which laſt, the received Philoſophy of the Times (which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends litle of the body of Nature) takes its begining. But ſuch <hi>Compound Motions</hi> (as <hi>Generation Corruption,</hi> and the reſt) ſhould be taken for the <hi>Summes</hi> and <hi>Products</hi> of ſimple Motions; rather than for <hi>Primitive Motions.

The recording and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of <hi>Doubts</hi> hath in it a two-fold uſe: <hi>One,</hi> that it mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites and fortifies Philoſophy againſt errors; when that which is not altogether ſo cleere and evident is not defin'd and avouched, (leſt error ſhould beget error) but a judgment upon it is ſuſpended, and is not definitive. <hi>The other</hi> that the entrie of <hi>Doubts,</hi> and recording of them, are ſo many Sponges which continually ſuck and draw in unto them an increaſe and improvement of Knowledge; whereby it comes to paſſe that thoſe things, which without the ſuggeſtion of Doubts had bin ſlightly, and without obſervation paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, are by occaſion of ſuch <hi>Dubitations,</hi> more ſeriouſly and attentively conſidered But theſe two utilities ſcarce recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence one diſcommodity, which unleſſe it be carefully lookt unto, inſinuateth it ſelfe; namely, <hi>That a Doubt once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as juſtly made, and become, as it were authentique; preſently ſtirres up defendants both waies; who in like manner commend over the ſame liberty of doubting to Poſteritie; ſo that men bend and apply their wits, rather to keepe a doubt ſtill on foot, than to determine and ſolve it.</hi> Jnſtances of this caſe we have every where, both in Iuriſconſults; and in Students in the Univerſities; who if they have once entertain'd a <hi>Doubt,</hi> it

And as for Poſsibility of Invention, there are ſome faint-hearted diſcoverers, who when they ſee nothing but Aire and Water, think there is no farther Land. But it is manifeſt that <hi>Plato,</hi> a man of an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated wit, and who beheld all things as from a high cliffe,<note place="margin">In Timeo alibi.</note> in his doctrine of Ideas, did diſcry, <hi>that formes were the true object of knowledge, however he loſt the reall fruit of this moſt true opinion, by contemplating and apprehending</hi> Formes, <hi>as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely abſtract from matters; and not confined and determined by matter: whereupon it came to paſſe that he turned himſelfe to Theologicall ſpeculations, which infected and diſtained all his Naturall Philoſophy.</hi> But if we keep a watchfull, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere eye upon Action and Uſe, it will not be difficult, to trace and find out what are the <hi>Formes;</hi> the diſcloſure whereof would wonderfully enrich and make happy the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of man. <hi>For the Formes of ſubſtances,</hi>

For, as it were not a thing eaſie, nor any way uſefull, <hi>to ſeeke the Forme of that ſound, which makes a word;</hi> being that words through compoſition and tranſpoſition of letters are infinite: <hi>but to enquire the Forme of ſound, which expreſſeth ſome ſimple letter</hi> (namely with what colliſion, with what application of the inſtruments of voice it is made) is a thing comprehenſible and eaſy; <hi>which forme of letters once known, preſently leads us to the forme of words.</hi> In the ſame manner to enquire the Forme of a Lyon, of an Oake, of Gold, nay of water, of Ayre is a vaine purſuit; but to enquire the <hi>Formes</hi> of <hi>Denſe, Rare; Hot, Cold; Heavy, Light; Tangible Pneumatique; Volatile, Fixt;</hi> and the like, both of <hi>Figurations</hi> and of <hi>Motions;</hi> whereof the moſt of them we have enumerated when we handled <hi>Phyſique,</hi> and are wont to call them, <hi>Formes of the first ranke or order;</hi> and which (as the letters of the Alphabet) are not ſo many in number, &amp; yet build up and ſupport the <hi>eſſences and Formes</hi> of all ſubſtances and this is that very point which we aime at, and endeavour to compaſſe; and which conſtitutes and defines that Part of <hi>Metaphyſique,</hi> whereof we now enquire. Nor doth this ſo prejudicate or hinder, but that <hi>Phyſique</hi> may conſider the ſame Natures alſo (as hath bin ſaid) but only according to the fluid and mutable cauſes. <hi>For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> if the cauſe of <hi>whiteneſſe in Snow or in Froth</hi> be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is well rendred, <hi>that it is the ſubtile intermixture of Aire with water.</hi> But this is farre from being the <hi>Forme of white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> being that aire intermixt with the duſt, or powder of Glaſſe, or Chryſtall, doth likewiſe produce <hi>whiteneſſe,</hi> as well as if it were mingled with water; but this is the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe only, which is no other than <hi>vehiculum Formae.</hi> But if the inquiry be made in <hi>Metaphyſique,</hi> you ſhall finde ſome ſuch rule as this, <hi>That two diaphanous bodies being intermixt, their optique Portions in a ſimple order, or equally placed, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine

               <p>§ <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is the duty and peculiar virtue of all Sciences, to abridge (as much as the conception of truth will permit) the ambages and long circuits of Experience, and ſo to apply a remedy to the ancient complaint of <hi>vita brevis,</hi>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:150781:144"/> of that <hi>Mechanicall</hi> Knowledge which is connext with <hi>Cauſes Phyſicall.</hi> But yet there falls out a certaine <hi>Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> or Experimentall Knowledge which neither is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Operative,</hi> nor yet properly reaches ſo high as ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> For all the Inventions of Operations which have come to mens Knowledge, either have fallen out by caſuall inſidence; and afterwards deliver'd from hand to hand; or were ſought out by a purpoſed experiment.

               <p>§ But it ſeemes requiſite in this place that the word <hi>Magia,</hi> accepted for a long time in the worſe part, be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ancient and honourable ſence. <hi>Magia, amongſt the Perſians,</hi> was taken for a ſublime ſapience, and a Science of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:150781:144"/> the Harmony and concents of univerſalls in Nature; ſo thoſe three <hi>Eaſterne Kings</hi> which came to adore <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are ſtiled by the name of <hi>Magi:</hi> and we underſtand it in that ſenſe, as to be, <hi>a Science which deduceth the knowledge of hidden formes to ſtrange and wonderfull effects &amp; operations; and as it is commonly ſaid, by joyning Actives with Paſsives, which diſcloſeth the great wonders of Nature.</hi> As for the <hi>Naturall Magique,</hi> (which flies abroad in many mens bookes) containing certain credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and ſuperſtitious traditions, and obſervations of <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathies,</hi> and <hi>Antipathies,</hi> and of hidden and ſpecifique pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, with ſome experiments commonly frivolous; ſtrange, rather for the art of convayance and diſguiſement, than the thing it ſelfe; ſurely he ſhall not much erre, who ſhall ſay, that this kind of magique, is as farre differing in truth of Nature, from ſuch a knowledge as we require; as the Bookes of the Geſts of <hi>Arthur</hi> of Brittaine, or of <hi>Hugh</hi> of Burdeaux, differs from <hi>Caeſars</hi> Commentaries, in truth of ſtory. For it is manifeſt, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> did greater things <hi>de ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> then they durſt faine of their <hi>Heroes;</hi> but he did them not in that fabulous manner. <hi>Of this kind of Learning, the Fable of</hi> Ixion <hi>was a figure;</hi> who projecting with himſelfe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy <hi>Juno</hi> the Goddeſſe of Power, had copulation with a <hi>cloude,</hi> of which he begot <hi>Centaures</hi> and <hi>Chimeraes.</hi> So who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are carried away with a frantique and impotent paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vaporous conceit to thoſe things which only, through the fumes and clouds of Imagination, they fancy to themſelves to ſee, in ſtead of ſubſtantiall operations; they are delivered of nothing but ayrie hopes, and certain defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and monſtrous apparitions. The operation and effect of this ſuperficiary, and degenerous <hi>Naturall Magique</hi> upon Men, is like ſome ſoporiferous drugges, which procure ſleep; and withall exhale into the fancy, merry and pleaſant dreams in ſleepe. <hi>Firſt</hi> it caſts mans underſtanding into a ſleep, ſtill chanting and ſuggeſting ſpecificique proprieties, and ſecret virtues; and ſent downe, as it were, from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to be delivered, and to be learned only by auricular tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; whence it comes to paſſe, that men are no more
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:150781:145"/> ſtirred up and awaked to ſearch with diligence, and to force out the true cauſes; but ſit downe ſatisfied with theſe frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and credulous opinions: and then it inſtilles an infinite number of pleaſing fictions, in the manner of dreams, and ſuch as one would moſt wiſh to be true. And it is worth the paines to note, that in theſe ſciences which hold ſo much of <hi>imagination</hi> (as are that <hi>adulterate Magique,</hi> whereof we now ſpeak, <hi>Alchymie, Astronomie</hi> and the like) the meanes and Theorie are ever more monſtrous, than the end and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. <hi>The turning of Silver</hi> or <hi>Quick-ſilver</hi> or any other met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall into Gold, is a hard thing to believe: yet it is a thing farre more probable, to a man well skilled, and experimented in the natures of waight; yellow Colour, malleable and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; as alſo fixt and volatile: and likewiſe to one who hath exactly ſearcht into the firſt ſeeds and menſtruous Purgings of Mineralls; that Gold by an induſtrious and curious wit, may, at laſt, be produced; than that a few graines of <hi>Elixir,</hi> or of the powder of Production, ſhould be of force, in a few Minutes, to turne Metalls into Gold, by the activity of the ſame <hi>Elixir;</hi> which is able to perfect nature, and to deliver it from all impediments. <hi>So the retarding of Age,</hi> or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoreing of ſome degree of youth, doth not eaſily purchaſe a beliefe: yet it is farre more likely to a man that knowes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly the nature of <hi>Arefaction,</hi> and the depredations of the ſpirits, upon the ſolide parts of the body; and hath through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved the nature of Aſsimilation, and of Alimentation; either more perfect or more peccant; alſo the nature of the ſpirits and of the Flame (as it were) of the body, aſsigned ſometimes to conſume, ſometimes to repaire; may by diets, Bathings, Anointings, proper Medicines, and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date motions, and the like, <hi>prolong life,</hi> or renew ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of youth, or vivacity: then that this ſhould be effected, by a few drops or ſcruples of <hi>ſome precious Liquor</hi> or Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſcence. <hi>Againe that Fates may be drawne from the ſtarres,</hi> men will not ſodainly, and eaſily aſſent unto; but theſe, that the houre of Nativity (which oftentimes through many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall accidents, is either accelerated or differed) ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150781:145"/> the fortune of the whole life; or that the houre of Queſtion is co-fatall with the thing it ſelfe which is ſought, you will ſay are meere impoſtures. But ſuch a raſh impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency and intemperance, doth poſſeſſe and infatuate the whole race of man; that they doe not only preſume upon, and promiſe to themſelves what is repugnant in nature to be performed; but alſo, are confident that they are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer even at their pleaſure, and that by way of recreation, the moſt difficult paſſages of nature, without trouble or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile. <hi>And of Magique</hi> thus much; the name whereof we have vindicated from reproach, and ſeparated the true and noble kind from the baſe and counterfeit.</p>

For as Phyſicall knowledge daily growes up, and new Actioms of nature are diſcloſed; there will be a neceſsity of new Mathematique inventions; and ſo at laſt more <hi>Mixt Mathematiques</hi> will be contrived. <hi>And now we have paſſed through the knowledge of Nature, and have noted the Deficients therein.</hi> Wherein if we have departed from the Ancient and received opinions, and thereby have moved contradiction; <hi>for our part, as we affect not to diſſent, ſo we purpoſe not to contend.</hi> If it be <hi>truth,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Cic. de LL. lib. 1.</note> which deſerves the more accurate handling by how much it toucheth us more neerly. <hi>This knowledge is to man the end and terme of Knowledges; but of Nature hir ſelfe, a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only.</hi> And generally let this be a rule, that all Diviſions of Knowledges be ſo accepted and applied,<note place="margin">Sen.

               <p>§ <hi>This being laid as a ground, let us proceed to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of man.</hi> This hath two parts: <hi>For it either conſidereth man ſegregate, or diſtributively; or congregate, and in ſocietie: the one we call Philoſophy of Humanity; the other Philoſophy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile.</hi> The <hi>Philoſophy of Humanity, or Humane,</hi> conſiſteth of the ſame Parts, whereof man himſelfe conſiſteth; that is of knowledges which reſpect the <hi>Body;</hi> and of knowledges which reſpect the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II <hi>But before</hi> we purſue particular Diſtributions, let us conſtitute; <hi>One generall Knowledge of the Nature and ſtate of man:</hi> For indeed it is very fit that this <hi>Knowledge</hi> be emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, and made a knowledge by it ſelfe. It is compos'd of thoſe <hi>Sympathies</hi> and <hi>Concordances</hi> commune between the <hi>Body</hi> and the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Againe, this Knowledge of the Nature and State of man</hi> may be diſtributed into two Parts; attributing to the one <hi>the undivided Nature of man;</hi> to the other <hi>the Combination between the Mind and the Body:</hi> The firſt of theſe we will call <hi>the knowledge of the Perſon ef man;</hi> the ſecond <hi>the knowledge of the League.</hi> And it is plaine that all theſe ſeverall Branches of Knowledge, being they are common and commixt, could not be aſſigned to that firſt Diviſion, of Knowledges, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about the <hi>Body;</hi> and of Knowledges converſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>The Knowledge concerning the Perſon of man,</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends ſpecially two things; namely the Contemplations of the <hi>Miſeries of Mankind;</hi> and of the <hi>Prerogatives, or Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the ſame.</hi> But the <hi>bewailing of mans miſeries</hi> hath bin e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legantly and copiouſly ſet forth by many in the writings, as well of Philoſophers, as Divines.<note n="✿" place="margin">TRIVMPHI HOMINIS, SIVE DE SVMMITA.

               <p>§ As for that other touching <hi>Mans Prerogatives,</hi> it is a point may well be ſet downe among DEFICIENTS. <hi>Pindar</hi> when he would extoll <hi>Hiero,</hi> ſpeakes (as uſually he doth) moſt elegantly, <hi>That he cropt off the tops,</hi>

In like manner the ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ſecurity of Mind hath appeared wonderfull in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny even at the inſtant approaches of Death; as that of a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion recorded by <hi>Tacitus;</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius Maximus,</hi> and C. <hi>Plinius;</hi> but it could be wiſht they had us'd more choice and Diligence.</p>
               <p n="3">III <hi>As touching the knowledge of the league, or mutuall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance between the body and the Mind;</hi> that may be diſtributed into two Parts. For as all <hi>leagues and Amities</hi> conſiſt of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall intelligence, and mutuall offices; ſo this <hi>league</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> is in like manner compriſed in theſe two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; that is, to deſcribe <hi>How theſe two, namely, the Mind and the body, diſcloſe one the other; and how one worketh upon the other, by diſcovery or Jndication;</hi> and by <hi>Jmpreſsion.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe (namely a deſcription what diſcovery may be made of the Mind, from the habit of the Body, or of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy from the Accidents of the Mind) hath begotten unto us
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:150781:151"/> two Arts, both of prediction; whereof the one is honoured with the Inquiry of <hi>Aristotle;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ariſt. Hipp.</note> and the other of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi> And although the moderne times, have polluted theſe Arts with ſuperſtitious and Phantaſticall mixtures, yet being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and reſtored to their true ſtate, they have both a ſolid ground in nature, and a profitable uſe in life.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The firſt is Phyſiognomy, which diſcovers the diſpoſitions of the mind, by the lineaments of the Body. The ſecond is the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Naturall dreams, which diſcovereth the state and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Body, from the Paſsions and Motions of the mind.</hi> In the <hi>Former</hi> of theſe,<note n="✿" place="margin">PHYSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OGNOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>A COR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PORIS IN MOTV.</note> I note a DEFICIENCE: <hi>for Ariſtotle hath very ingeniouſly and diligently handled the Poſtures of the Body, while it is at Reſt; but not the Geſtures of the Body when it is in Motion; which are no leſſe comprehenſible by Art, and of Greater uſe.</hi> For the lineaments of the Body, doe diſcloſe the Inclinations and Proclivities of the Mind in generall; but the Motions and Geſtures of the face and Parts, doe not only ſo, but further declare the Acceſſes, and Seaſons, and Prognoſtiques of the preſent diſpoſition, and of the will. For, to uſe your Majeſties moſt apt and elegant expreſsion, <hi>The tongue ſpeaks to the eare,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">IACOBUS R.</note> 
                  <hi>but the geſture ſpeaks to the eye.</hi> And therefore a number of old ſubtile and craftie Perſons, whoſe eyes doe dwell upon the faces and faſhions of Men, doe well know this obſervation; and can turne it to their owne advantage, as being a great part of their ability and wiſdome. Neither indeed can it be denied, but that this is a great diſcovery of diſsimulation in an other, and a great direction, for the election of ſeaſons, and opportunities of approaching to perſons; which is not the meaneſt part of Civile Prudence. And let no man think that ſuch a dexterity, may ſomewhat availe, in reſpect of ſome Particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but cannot be comprehended under rule: for we all laugh and weepe, and bluſh, and bend the brow much after the ſame manner; and ſo for moſt part it is in other more ſubtile motions. As for <hi>Chiromancy,</hi> it is a meere impoſture.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>And as touching the expoſition of Dreames;</hi> it is a ſubject handled in ſome mens writings, but foild with many idle
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150781:151"/> vanities; only thus much for the preſent I doe Inſinuate, that this knowledge of <hi>interpreting Dreams,</hi> wants the ſupport of a ſolid Baſe; and that foundation is this, <hi>where the ſame effect is wrought, by an inward cauſe, that uſeth to be wrought by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; that externe Act is transformed into a Dreame.</hi> The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ſtomack from a groſſe vapour, and from the poiſe of ſome outward waight, are a like; wherefore they that labour of the <hi>Night-mare</hi> doe dreame, that a waight is put upon them, with a great preparation of circumſtances. The fluctuation or penſility of the Bowells, from the agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the waves in the ſea, and from the winde gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> are a like: therefore ſuch as are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the Hypocondriaque wind, doe often dream of Navigations, and agitations upon the waters. There are an infinite number of ſuch like inſtances.</p>
               <p>§ The other branch of the <hi>knowledge of the league</hi> (which we have called <hi>Impreſsion</hi>) hath not as yet bin col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into Art, but hath ſometimes intervened among other Treatiſes ſparſedly, and as in paſſage only. It hath the ſame Antiſtrophe with the former: for the conſideration is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>either how, and how farre the humors and temperament of the body, doe alter or worke upon the mind?</hi> Or againe, <hi>How and how farre, the Paſsions and apprehenſions of the mind doe alter or work upon the Body.</hi> The former of theſe we ſee ſometimes handled in the Art of Phyſique; but the ſame hath by ſtrange waies inſinuated it ſelfe into Religion. For the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian preſcribes Remedies to cure the Maladies of the mind; as in the cures of Frenzies and Melancholy: they doe alſo adminiſter Phyſique to exhilerate the Mind; to munite and ſtrengthen the heart, and ſo to increaſe the courage, to ſharpen and clarify the wits, to corroborate the Memory, and the like. But Dietes, and choice of meats, and drinks, and other obſervances touching the Body, in the ſect of the <hi>Pythagoreans;</hi> in the Hereſie of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and in the law of <hi>Mahomet</hi> doe exceed all meaſure. So likewiſe <hi>the ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Ceremoniall Law, interdicting the eating of the bloud;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; the Fat;</hi> and <hi>diſtinguiſhing between beaſts clean and unclean,</hi> ſo
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150781:152"/> farre as they are for meat, are many and ſtrict. Nay the Chriſtian faith it ſelfe, though cleere and ſyncere from all clouds of ceremonies; yet retaines the uſe of Faſtings; Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinences; and other obſervances, which tend to the mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and humiliation of the Body; as things not meerely Figurative; but alſo Fruitfull. The root and life of all ſuch preſcripts as theſe, (beſides the Ceremony it ſelfe, and the practiſe of Canonicall obedience,) conſiſts in this whereof we ſpeak, namely, <hi>that there may be a mutuall ſufferance and humiliation of the ſoule with the Body.</hi> And if any man of weaker judgement doe conceive, that theſe impreſsions of the Body upon the Mind, doe either queſtion the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, or derogate from the ſoveraignty of the ſoule over the Body; to an eaſy doubt, an eaſy anſwere is ſufficient. Let him take theſe inſtances; <hi>either from an Jnfant in the Mothers wombe, which is compatible with the Accidents and Symptomes of the mother, and yet ſeparable in its ſeaſon, from the Body of the Mother:</hi> Or from Monarques, who though they have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute power, are ſome times inclined by the ſway of their Servants; yet without ſubjection of their Perſons or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of their Power.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Now as for the reciprocall part, the operations of the ſoule, and of the Effects and Paſsions thereof upon the Body;</hi> that alſo hath found a place in Medicine. For all wiſe Phyſitians doe ever conſider and handle, <hi>Accidentia Animi,</hi> as a matter of great moment, for their Cures; and which are of great force to further or hinder all other Remedies. But there is an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervation pertinent to this ſubject, which hath bin very ſparingly inquired into; and nothing to the depth and dignity of the thing; that is, (ſetting aſide the affections) <hi>how farre the Imagination of the Mind, or a thought deeply fixt; and exalted as it were, into a beliefe, is of Power to alter the Body of the Jmaginant?</hi> For though it hath a manifeſt power to hurt, it followes not that it hath the ſame degree of power to help. No more indeed, than if a man ſhould conclude that becauſe their be peſtilent Aires able ſodainly to kill a man in health; therefore there ſhould be Soveraigne Aires,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150781:152"/> able ſodainly to cure a man in ſickneſſe.<note place="margin">Laert. in V.</note> 
                  <hi>This Inquiſition</hi> would certainly be of excellent uſe, but as <hi>Socrates</hi> ſaid, it <hi>needs a Delian Diver,</hi> being couered with darkneſſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity. <hi>Againe,</hi> of all theſe Knowledges, <hi>de Foedere;</hi> or of the <hi>Concordances between the Mind and the Body,</hi> there is no part more neceſſary than the diſquiſition of the <hi>Seates</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miciles,</hi> which the ſeverall faculties of the mind doe take and occupate in the Body, and the Organes thereof.

               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Medicine</hi> is a noble Art; and according to the Poets deſcended of a moſt generous race; for they have brought in <hi>Apollo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Homer. Hym. Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan. alii.</note> as the chiefe God of Medicine, to whom they have aſſigned <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> for his ſonne; a God too, and a Profeſſor of <hi>Phyſique: Becauſe in things naturall the Sunne is the Auctor, and Fountaine of Life; the Phyſitian the Conſerver of Nature; and as it were a ſecond ſpring of Life.</hi> But the greateſt glory to <hi>Phyſique</hi> is from the workes of our Saviour, who was a Phyſitian both of Soule and Body: And as he made the Soule the peculiar object of his heavenly Doctrine; ſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the body the proper ſubject of his miracles. For we never read of any miracles done by him reſpecting Honour, or Wealth, (beſides that one when Tribute was to be given to <hi>Caeſar</hi>), but only reſpecting the Body of man; or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, or to ſuſtaine, or to cure it.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The Subject of Medicine</hi> (namely <hi>mans Body</hi>) is of all other things which nature hath brought forth moſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of remedy; but then that remedy is moſt capable of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: For the ſame ſubtility, and variety of the ſubject, as it affords great poſſibility of Cure, ſo it gives great facility to error. Wherefore as that Art (ſuch as now it is) may well be reckon'd amongſt Arts conjecturall; ſo the enquiry thereof may be placed in the number of the moſt difficult, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteſt Arts. Neither yet are we ſo ſenſeleſſe, as to imagine with <hi>Paracelſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paramiri. lib. 4. Rob. Flud. paſſim.</note> and the Alchymiſts; <hi>That there are to be found in mans Body certaine Correſpondences, and Parallels to all the variety of ſpecifique Natures in the world</hi> (as <hi>Starres, Minerals,</hi> and the reſt) as they fooliſhly fancy and Mythologize; ſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but very impertinently, that embleme of the Ancients, <hi>That man was Microcoſmus, an abſtract, or modell of the whole world,</hi> to countenance their fabulous, and fictious invention. Yet notwithſtanding this is an evident truth, (which we were about to ſay) <hi>that amongst all Bodies Naturall, there is not found any ſo multipliciouſly compounded as the Body of man.</hi> For we ſee Hearbes, and Plants, are nouriſhed by earth and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:150781:153"/> water; Beaſts by Hearbes and Fruicts: But man by the fleſh of living Creatures; as Beaſts, Birds, Fiſh; and alſo of Hearbes, Graines, Fruicts, Iuice, and diverſe Liquors; not without manifold commixtures, ſeaſoning, and, Preparation of theſe Bodies before they come to be mans meate, and aliment. Adde hereunto, that Beaſts have a more ſimple order of life, and leſſe change of affections to worke upon their Bodies, and they commonly working one way; whereas man in his Manſions, exerciſes, Paſſions, ſleepe, and vigilancies is ſubject to infinite viciſſitudes of changes. So that it is moſt evident that of all other naturall ſubſtances, the Body of man is the moſt fermentated, compounded, and incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Maſſe. The ſoule, on the other ſide, is the ſimpleſt of ſubſtances, as it is well expreſt; —<hi>Purum<expan>

So then this inconſtancy, and variety of the ſubject, hath made the Art more conjecturall: And the Art being ſo conjecturall had given more large ſcope, not only to error, but even to impoſture. <hi>For almost all other Arts and Sciences are judg'd by their power and operation; and not by their ſucceſſe and worke. The Lawyer is judg'd by the virtue of his pleading, and not by the iſſue of the Cauſe; the Maſter in the Ship approves his Art, by the directing his courſe aright, and not by the fortune of the voyage. But the Phyſitian; and perhaps the Politique hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have any proper particular Acts, whereby they may make a cleer demonstration of their Art and abilities; but beare away ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſgrace principally from the event which is ever an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:150781:154"/> judicature.</hi> For who can tell if a Patient dye or recover; or if a State be preſerved or ruin'd; whether it be by Art or Accident? Therefore it often falls out, that the impoſtor beares away the Prize, virtue the Cenſure. Nay the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and credulity of men is ſuch, <hi>As they often preferre a Montebank, or Witch, before a Learn'd Phyſitian.</hi> Therefore the Poets were cleer and quick-ſighted when they made <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> and <hi>Circe,</hi> Brother and Siſter; both children of the Sun, as in the Verſes; of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> the Suns Son,

                  <hi>why ſhould J labour to be more wiſe?</hi> And therefore I cannot much blame Phyſitians, if they uſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to intend ſome other Art, or Practiſe, which they fancy more than their Profeſſion: For you ſhall have of them Poets; Antiquaries; Critiques; Rhetoricians; Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques; Divines; &amp; in theſe Arts better ſeen, than in their own profeſſion.<note place="margin">Agrip. de van. ſcien.</note> Nor doth this come to paſſe, as I ſuppoſe, becauſe (as a certaine Declaimor againſt ſciences objects againſt Phyſitians) they have ever Converſant before their eyes ſuch loathſome and ſad ſpectacles, that they muſt needs retire their minds from theſe objects, to ſome other contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for as they are men, <hi>Nihil Humani a ſe alienum putent;</hi> but for this reaſon, whereof we now ſpeake; namely, that they find, <hi>that Mediocrity, and excellency in their Art, maketh no difference in profit or reputation towards their Perſons or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</hi> For the vexations of ſickneſſe; the ſweetneſſe of life;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:150781:154"/> the flattery of hope; the commendation of friends; maketh men to depend upon Phyſitians with all their defects: But if a man ſeriouſly waigh the matter, theſe things rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the imputation of Phyſitians, than their excuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: who ſhould not for theſe prejudices caſt away hope; but encreaſe their pains and diligence. For whoſoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to excite and awake his obſervation, and a litle look about him, ſhall eaſily deprehend even from common and familiar examples, what a command and ſoveraignty the ſubtletie and ſharpneſſe of the underſtanding hath over the variety either of matter, or of the forme of things. <hi>Nothing is more variable than mens faces</hi> and countenances; yet the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory retaines the infinite diſtinctions of them: Nay a Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with a few ſhells of Collours; the benefit of his eye; the habit of his Imagination; and the ſteadineſſe of his hand; can imitate, and draw with his pencill all faces that are, have bin, or ever ſhall be; if they were brought before him: <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more variable than mans voice;</hi> yet we can eaſily diſcerne their differences in every particular perſon; nay you ſhall have a Buffóne, or a Pantómimus will render and expreſſe to the life, as many as he pleaſeth. <hi>Nothing more variable than articulate ſounds of words,</hi> yet men have found away to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to a few letters of the Alphabet. And this is moſt certaine, <hi>that it is not the inſufficiency, or incapacity of mans mind; but rather the remote ſtanding, or placing of the object that breeds theſe Mazes, and Incomprehenſions.</hi> For as the ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre off is full of miſtaking; but within due diſtance erres not much; ſo it is in the underſtanding. <hi>For men uſe common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take a Proſpect of Nature, as from ſome high Turret, and to view hir afarre off; and are too much taken up with generalities, whereas if they would vouchſafe to deſcend and approach neerer to Particulars; and more exactly and conſiderately look into things themſelves; there might be made a more true &amp; profitable diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry &amp; comprehenſion.</hi> Now the remedy of this error, <hi>is not alone this, to quicken or ſtrengthen the Organ; but withall to goe neerer to the obiect;</hi> And therefore there is no doubt but if Phyſitians, letting Generalities goe, for a while, and ſuſpending their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:150781:155"/> thereto, would make their approaches to Nature; they might become Maſters of that Art, whereof the Poet ſpeakes,

               <p>§ <hi>Medicine therefore</hi> (as we have ſeene) hitherto hath bin ſuch, as hath bin more profeſſed, than laboured; and yet more laboured than advanced; ſeeing the paines beſtowed thereon, hath bin rather in circle, than in progreſſion. <hi>For I find much Iteration but ſmall Addition in Writers of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ But for this laſt duty, Phyſitians ſeeme not to have acknowledg'd it as any principall part of their Art; but have (ignorantly enough) mingled and confounded it as one and the ſame with the other two. <hi>For</hi> they ſuppoſe, that if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes be repelled before they ſeize upon the body; or be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after they have ſurpriz'd the body; that <hi>Prolongation of Life</hi> muſt naturally follow. Which though it be ſo, without all queſtion, yet they doe not ſo exactly conſider; that theſe two offices of <hi>Conſervation</hi> and <hi>Curation,</hi> only pertain to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes; and to ſuch <hi>Prolongation of Life</hi> alone, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated &amp; intercepted by diſeaſes: But <hi>to draw out the thread of Life,</hi> and to prorogue Death, for a ſeaſon which ſilently ſteales upon us, by naturall reſolution, and the Atrophie of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:150781:155"/> Age; is an argument that no Phyſitian hath handled it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Merit of the ſubject <hi>Neither let that ſcruple trouble the minds of Men,</hi>

                  <hi>as if this thing committed to the diſpenſation of Fate, and the divine providence, were now by us firſt repealed and commended, to the charge and office of Art:</hi> For without doubt Providence doth diſpoſe and determine all kind of deaths whatſoever, whether they come of violence, or from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, or from the Courſe of Age; and yet doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exclude Preventions and Remedies: For Art and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man induſtry doe not command and rule Fate, and nature; but ſerve and adminiſter unto them. <hi>But</hi> of this part we ſhall ſpeak anon; thus much in the meane by way of antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, leaſt any ſhould unskilfully confound this <hi>third office</hi> of Medicine, with the two former, which uſually hitherto hath bin done.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for the duty of preſervation of Health,</hi> the firſt duty of the three, many have written thereof, as in other points ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impertinently, ſo (in our judgement) in this particular; in attributing too much to the quality of meats, and too litle to the quantity thereof: and in the quantity it ſelfe, they have diſcourſed like Morall Philoſophers, exceſsively praiſing Mediocrity; whereas both <hi>fasting</hi> changed to cuſtome, and <hi>full feeding,</hi> to which a man hath inured himſelfe, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>regiments of health,</hi> than thoſe <hi>Mediocrities</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly enervate Nature, and make hir ſlothfull, and impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if need ſhould be, of any extremity, exceſſe or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. And for the divers kindes of <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> which much conduce to the <hi>conſervation of health,</hi> none of that profeſsion hath well diſtinguiſht or obſerved; whereas there is hardly found any diſpoſition to a diſeaſe, which may not be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by ſome kind of exerciſe proper to ſuch an infirmity. As bowling is good againſt the weakneſſe of the Reines; ſhooteing againſt the obſtruction of the Longes; walking and upright deport of the body, againſt the crudities of the ſtomack; and for other diſeaſes other exercitations. But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this part touching <hi>the conſervation of health,</hi> hath bin in every point after a ſort handled, it is not out purpoſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue leſſer deficiencies.</p>

In this ſecond Duty of Medicine, many things are <hi>deficient;</hi> of theſe we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound a few, which are more remarkable, which to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate without preciſe order or Method, we ſuppoſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>

Therefore having ſo proper and notable a precident from him, who was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Father of the Art, we ſhall not need to alleage any example forraine, fetcht from other Arts; as from the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the lawyers, with whom nothing is more uſuall, than to ſet downe and enter more notable caſes, and new deciſions, whereby they may the better furniſh and direct themſelves for the definition of future caſes. <hi>Wherefore I finde this continuation of Medicinall Reports deficient,</hi> ſpecially digeſted into one entire Body, with diligence and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which yet I underſtand not to be made ſo ample, as to extend to every common caſe that daily falls out (for that were an infinite worke and to ſmall purpoſe) nor yet ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and contracted as to admit none, but Prodigies, and wonders; as many have done: for many things are new in the <hi>manner</hi> and circumſtances of the thing; which are not <hi>new</hi> in the <hi>kinde;</hi> and he that ſhall give his mind to obſerve, ſhall finde many things even in matters vulgar worthy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>

<pb n="193" facs="tcp:150781:156"/> cleerely handled; <hi>but</hi> COMPARATIVE ANATOMIE, <hi>I define to be deficient.</hi> For men have made a good enquiry into all the parts, and into their conſiſtencies, figures, and colloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but the diverſe figure, condition, and poſture of thoſe parts in diverſe men, they have not ſo well obſerved. The reaſon of this omiſsion I ſuppoſe is no other than this, that the firſt inquiry may be ſatisfied in the view of one or two Anatomies; but the later, being COMPARATIVE and Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, muſt ariſe from the attentive and exact obſervation of many <hi>Diſſections:</hi> and the firſt is a matter, wherein learned Profeſſors in their Lectures, &amp; the preſſe of ſpectators ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about them, may vaunt themſelves; but the ſecond kind of <hi>Anatomie,</hi> is a ſevere knowledge, which muſt be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a retired ſpeculation, and a long experience.

               <p>§ <hi>And in theſe differences of inward parts,</hi> there are often found the <hi>Cauſes continent</hi> of many diſeaſes; which Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans not obſerving, doe ſometime accuſe the Humors which are not delinquent, the fault being in the very Mechanique Frame of ſome part. In the cure of which Diſeaſes, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Alterative Medicines,</hi> is to no purpoſe (becauſe the part peccant is incapable of ſuch alteration,) but the matter muſt be mended, and accommodated, or palliated by a preſcript Diet and familiar Medicines. So likewiſe to COMPARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE ANATOMY appertaine accurate obſervations, as well of all kind of humors, as of the footſteps and impreſsions of diſeaſes in diverſe bodies diſſected: for the Humors, in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomies are commonly paſt by, as if they were ſuperfluous Purgaments and Excrements; whereas it is a point very uſefull and neceſſary, to note of what nature and of how various kinds there be of different humors (not relieing herein too much upon the received diviſions,) which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may be found in the body of Man; and in what Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

In like manner the <hi>foot-steps</hi> and <hi>Jmpreſsions</hi> of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and the leſions and devaſtations of the inward parts by them, are to be obſerved with diligence in diverſe <hi>Anatomies;</hi> as impoſthumes, ulcerations, ſolutions of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuity, putrefactions, corroſions, conſumptions, luxations, diſlocations, obſtructions, repletions, tumors; together with all preternaturall excreſcencies, found in mans body (as ſtones, carnoſities, wens, wormes, and the like;) I ſay all theſe, and ſuch other, ſhould be with great diligence inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and digeſted by that COMPARATITE ANATOMY, whereof we ſpeak, and the experiments of many Phyſitians collected and collated together. <hi>But this variety of Accidents,</hi> is by Anatomiſts, either handled perfunctorily, or elſe paſt over in ſilence.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Touching that other Defect in Anatomie, (namely, that it hath not been uſed to be practiſed upon living Bodies,)</hi> to what end ſhould we ſpeak of it? for this is an odious and an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane experiment,<note place="margin">De Re Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica.</note> and by <hi>Celſus</hi> juſtly condemned: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that obſervation of the Ancients is true, That many Pores, Paſſages and Pertuſions, which are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile than the reſt, appeare not in <hi>Anatomicall diſſections,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſhut and latent in Dead <hi>Bodies;</hi> whereas they are open and manifeſt in LIVE.

For the Phyſitians have fruſtrated and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the fruit of Traditions, and approved experience, by their <hi>Magistralities;</hi> in adding and taking out, and changing ingredients of Receipts at their pleaſure; and almoſt after the manner of Apothecaries, putting in <hi>Quid pro Quo;</hi> commanding ſo preſumptuouſly over Medicine, as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine can no longer command the diſeaſe. For except <hi>Treacle,</hi> and <hi>Mithridatum,</hi> and of late <hi>Dioſcordium;</hi> and the confection of <hi>Alkermes,</hi> and a few more Medicines; they commonly tye themſelves to no receipts ſeverely and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the confections of ſale, which are in the ſhoppes, they are in readineſſe rather for generall purpoſes, than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate and proper for particular cures; for they doe not exactly referre to any diſeaſe in ſpeciall; but generally to the opening of obſtructions, comforting concoction, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſtemperatures. And this is the cauſe why <hi>Empy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques</hi> and <hi>Old woemen</hi> are more happy many times in their Cures, than Learned Phyſitians; becauſe they are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſcrupulous in keeping themſelves to the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and compoſition of approved <hi>Medicines. I remember that a Phyſitian</hi> with us here in England, famous for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in religion halfe Iew, and almoſt an Arabian for his courſe of ſtudy wont to ſay, <hi>your Europaean Phyſitians are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Learned men, but they know not the Particular Cures of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes:</hi> And the ſame perſon uſed to jeſt, but unreverently, ſaying, <hi>That our Phyſitians were like Biſhops, they had the Keyes of binding and looſing, and nothing elſe.</hi> But to ſpeake the truth in earneſt; in our opinion it would be a matter of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, if ſome Phyſitians of Note for Learning and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, would compile <hi>a worke of Probations, and experimented Medicines for the cure of Particular Diſeaſes:</hi> For that any
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:150781:158"/> man, induced by ſome ſpecious reaſon, ſhould be of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it is the part of a learned Phyſitian (reſpecting the complexions of Patients, their Age; the ſeaſon of the yeare, Cuſtomes and the like, rather to accommodate his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines as occaſions ſuggeſt, than to inſiſt upon ſome certain Preſcripts, is a deceiveable aſſertion, and which attributes too litle to experience, too much to judgment. <hi>Certainly</hi> as in the ſtate of Rome they were the men moſt uſefull, and of the beſt compoſition, which either being Conſuls favoured the People, or being Tribunes inclined to the Senate: So in the matter we now handle, they be the beſt Phyſitians, which either in their great Learning, doe much valew the Traditions of Experience; or being famous for Practice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not Methods and Generalities of Art. <hi>As for qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of Medicines (if at any time that be expedient) they are rather to be practis'd upon the Defferents of Phyſique, than incorporated into the Receipt, wherein nothing ſhould be innovated without apparent neceſſity. <hi>Wherefore this Part which handleth Authentique and Poſitive Medicines,</hi> we report as DEFICIENT:<note place="margin">✿</note> but it is a matter not to be attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted or undertaken without a ſharpe and piercing judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and as it were, in a Synod of ſelect Phyſitians.</p>
               <p>§ Alſo in the <hi>Preparations of Medicines</hi> I doe find it ſtrange (ſpecially conſidering how <hi>Minerall Medicines</hi> have bin ſo extolled and celebrated by Chymiſts;<note place="margin">IMITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIO THER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARVM NATV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RALIVM.</note> and that they are ſafer for the outward than inward Parts) <hi>that no man hitherto hath endeavoured by Art to imitate Naturall Bathes, and Medicinable Fountaines;</hi> and yet it is confeſſed that <hi>thoſe Bathes and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> receive their vertues from minerall veines through which they paſſe: and for manifeſt proofe hereof mans induſtry knows well how to diſcerne and diſtinguiſh from what kind of Mineralls ſuch waters receive their tinctures; as whether from Sulphur; Vitriol; Steele, or the like: <hi>which naturall tinctures of waters,</hi> if it may be reduced to compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Art, it would be in mans power, both to make more kinds of them as occaſion required; and to command, at pleaſure, the temperament thereof. <hi>Therefore this Part of the

It were a ſtrange ſpeech which ſpoken, or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken oft, ſhould reclaim a man from a vice deeply rooted and inveterate. Certainly it is farre otherwiſe: <hi>But it is order, Purſuit, ſequence, Artificiall interchange, that are potent and mighty in nature:</hi> Which although they require more exact judgment in preſcribing; and more preciſe obedience in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, yet this is amply recompenced in the greatneſſe of effects. And although a man would think, by the daily dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Phyſitians, their Viſitations, Seſſions, and Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, which they performe to the ſick; that they did pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purſue the Cure; and goe on in a certaine courſe: Yet let a man exactly look into their preſcripts, and miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he ſhall find many of them full of wavering, inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and every dayes deviſes; and ſuch as came into their minds without any certaine, or adviſed courſe of Cure. <hi>For they ſhould even from the beginning, after they have made a full and perfect diſcovery of the diſeaſe, meditate and reſolve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an orderly ſequence of Cure; and not without important rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons depart therefrom.</hi> And let Phyſitians know for certaine, that (for example) three perchance, or foure receipts, are rightly preſcribed for the Cure of ſome great diſeaſe; which taken <hi>in due order, and in due ſpaces of time performe the Cure; which if they were taken ſingle, or by themſelves alone; or if the Courſe were inverted, or the intervalls of time not obſerved, would be hurtfull.</hi> Nor is it yet our meaning that every ſcrupulous
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:150781:159"/> and ſuperſtitious way of Cure in eſtimation ſhould be the beſt; no more than that every ſtrait way is the way to Heaven, but that the way ſhould be right as well as ſtrait and difficult. <hi>And this Part</hi> which we will call <hi>Filum Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinale</hi> we ſet downe as <hi>Deficient.</hi> So theſe are the Parts which in the <hi>Knowledge of Medicine,</hi> touching the cure of Diſeaſes, are <hi>deſiderate,</hi> ſave that there remaines yet one part more of more uſe than all the other, which is here wanting, <hi>A true and Active naturall Philoſophie, upon which the ſcience of Medicine ſhould be built:</hi> but that belongs not to this Treatiſe.</p>

               <p>§ <hi>Secondly, we advertiſe,</hi> that the intentions of Phyſitians touching this Argument are nothing worth: and that they rather lead men away from the point, than direct them unto it.

               <p>§ <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we admoniſh men that they ceaſe to trifle, and that they be not ſo credulous as to think that ſuch a great worke as this is, <hi>to retard and turne back the courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> may be brought to perfection by a morning draught, or the uſe of ſome precious Receipt; no not with <hi>Aurum Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> or the ſubſtances of Pearles, or ſuch like toyes; but that they take it for a grounded truth, that the <hi>Prolongation of Life,</hi> is a great work, and which conſiſts in many kinds of Receipts, and of an orderly courſe and connexion of them: And let no man be ſo ſtupid as to believe, <hi>that what never yet was done, can be now effected, but by meanes yet never attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Fourthly we admoniſh men that they rightly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and diſtinguiſh touching thoſe Receits which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a <hi>healthfull life,</hi> and thoſe which conferre to a <hi>long life.</hi> For there are many things which exhilarate the ſpirits, ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the active powers of nature, repell diſeaſes, which yet ſubduct from the ſumme of life, and without ſickneſſe accelerate aged <hi>Atrophie.</hi> And there are other receipts which conduce to the <hi>Prolongation of life,</hi> and the <hi>retardati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Atrophie of old-age;</hi> but yet are not us'd without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of health: So that they who uſe theſe remedies for the <hi>prorogation of life,</hi> muſt likewiſe provide againſt ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences as upon their uſage may unexpectedly fal out. And thus much by way of Admonition.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for Indications,</hi> the image, or Idea we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in our mind hereof, is this; Things are conſerv'd and
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:150781:160"/> Continued two wayes; either in their owne Identitie, or by <hi>Reparation. In their proper Jdentitie,</hi> as a Flie or an Ant in <hi>Amber;</hi> a flower, an apple or wood in Conſervatories of Snow; a dead corps in Balſame. By <hi>Reparation,</hi> as in Flame, and Mechanique. He that goes about the worke of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of Life,</hi> muſt put in practice both theſe kinds, (for diſunited, their ſtrength is weakned) and <hi>Mans body</hi> muſt be <hi>conſerv'd</hi> after the ſame manner <hi>inanimate Bodies</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and againe, as <hi>Flame</hi> is conſerved; and laſtly, even as <hi>Mechaniques</hi> are conſerved. <hi>Wherefore there are three intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Prolongation of Life; the Retardation of Conſumption; the Integrity of the Reparation; and the Renovation of that which begun to decay and grow old. Conſumption</hi> is caus'd by two <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations, Depredation</hi> of <hi>innate Spirit;</hi> and <hi>Depredation</hi> of <hi>ambient Aire.</hi> The reſiſtance of both is two-fold, either when the <hi>Agents</hi> (that is, the ſuc and moiſtures of the Body) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come leſſe <hi>Predatory;</hi> or the <hi>Patients</hi> are made leſſe depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is made leſſe <hi>Predatory,</hi> if either it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed in ſubſtance, as in the uſe of Opiates, and nitrous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and in contriſtations; or be <hi>diminiſhed in Quantity,</hi> as in ſpare Pythagoricall or Monaſticall Diets: or is ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and <hi>refreſht with motion,</hi> as in eaſe and tranquility. <hi>Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Aire</hi> is made leſſe <hi>Predatory,</hi> either when it is <hi>leſſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the beames of the Sunne,</hi> as in colder countries; in Caves, in Hills, and in the Pillars or Stations of Anchorites; or when it is repell'd from the Body as in dens-cloſe skin; in the Plumage of birds, and the uſe of oyle and unguents without Aromatique Ingredients. <hi>The juyce</hi> and ſucculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Body, are made leſſe depredable, if either they be made more indurate, or more <hi>dewy,</hi> and <hi>oyly:</hi> Indurate as in <hi>auſtere courſe Diet;</hi> in <hi>a life accuſtomed to cold,</hi> by <hi>ſtrong exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes;</hi> by <hi>certaine Minerall Bathes.</hi> Roſcide or dewy, as in the uſe of ſweet meats and abſtinence from meats, ſalt and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide; but eſpecially in ſuch a mixture of drinks, as is of parts very tenuious and ſubtle, and yet without all acrimony or tartneſſe. <hi>Reparation is done by Aliments;</hi> and Alimentation is promoted foure wayes: <hi>By the Concoction of the inward Parts</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:150781:161"/> for the ſending forth of the nouriſhment; as in <hi>Confortatives</hi> of the Principall Bowells; <hi>by excitation of the outwart parts</hi> for the attraction of nouriſhment, as in <hi>due exerciſes</hi> and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and ſome kind of unctions and appropriate Bathes; <hi>by preparation of the Aliment it ſelfe;</hi> that it may more eaſily inſinuate it ſelfe, and in a ſort anticipate Digeſtions, as in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and artificiall kinds of <hi>ſeaſoning meat, mingling drinke, leavening bread,</hi> and reducing the virtues of all theſe three into one; <hi>by comforting</hi> the laſt act of <hi>Aſsimilation,</hi> as in <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſleep,</hi> and outward or <hi>Topique Applications: the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that which began to waxe old,</hi> is performed two waies, either by <hi>inteneration of the habit of the body</hi> it ſelfe, as in the uſe of ſuppleing or ſoftning applications by Bathes, emplaſters and unctions, of ſuch quality as may ſoak or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate into the part, but not extract from it; or by <hi>expurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old moiſture, and ſubſtitution of new moiſture,</hi> as in ſeaſonable and often purging; letting of blood; attenuating Diets, which reſtore the Flower of the Body, and ſo much for <hi>Jndications.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for Precepts,</hi> although many of them may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the <hi>Jndications,</hi> yet we thought good to ſet downe three of the moſt principall. <hi>Firſt</hi> we give in <hi>Precept</hi> that the <hi>Prolongation of life,</hi> muſt be expected from a preſcript ſet Diet, rather than from any familiar regiment of Foode, or the excellency of particular receipts: for whatſoever are of ſuch virtue as they are able to make nature <hi>retrograde,</hi> are commonly more ſtrong and Potent to <hi>alter,</hi> than that they can be compounded together in any medicine, much leſſe be intermingled in familiar foode. It remaines therefore that ſuch receipts be adminiſtred regularly, and ſucceſsively and at ſet appointed times, returning in certain courſes.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Our ſecond Precept is, that the Prolongation of life be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, rather from working upon ſpirits, and from a malaciſſation or inteneration of Parts, than from any kinds of aliment or order of Diet.</hi> For ſeeing the Body of Man and the Frame thereof (leaving aſide outward accidents) three waies becomes Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, namely <hi>from the ſpirits; from the parts; and from aliments;</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:150781:161"/> the way of <hi>Prolongation of life</hi> by means of aliment is a long way about, and that by many ambages and circuits; but the waies by working upon the ſpirits, and upon the parts, are more compendious and ſooner brings us to the end deſired; becauſe the ſpirits are ſodainly moved, both from vapours and paſsions, which work ſtrangely upon them: and the Parts, by Bathes, unguents or emplaiſters, which in like manner make way by ſodaine impreſsions.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Our third Precept is, that Malaciſſation or inteneration of Parts by outward Topiques, must be performed by applications conſubſtantiall, Penetrating, and Sringent.</hi> Conſubſtantialls are Willingly intertained with a kindly embrace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly intenerate and ſupple; <hi>Penetrating</hi> and inſinuating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are the Defferrents, as it were, of Malaciſſant and mollifying qualities, and convay more eaſily and impreſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the virtue thereof; and doe themſelves ſomewhat expand and open the Parts. <hi>Restringents</hi> keep in the virtue of them both, and for a time fixe it, and alſo cohibite and repreſſe perſpiration; which is a thing repugnant to <hi>malaciſſation or ſuppleing,</hi> becauſe it ſends forth the moiſture; wherefore by theſe three (but diſpoſed in order, and ſucceeding, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt) the matter is effected. <hi>Jn the mean</hi> we give this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, that it is not the intention of <hi>Malaciſſation</hi> by outward topiques to nouriſh Parts; but only to render them more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of nouriſhment: for whatſoever is more drie, is leſſe Active to aſsimilate. And thus much of the <hi>Prolongation of life,</hi> which is a third part newly aſsigned to Medicine.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Come we now to Coſmetique medicaments, or the Art of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration;</hi> which hath indeed, parts Civile, and parts effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For cleanneſſe, and the <hi>civile beauty</hi> of the Body was ever eſtimed to proceed from a modeſty of behaviour, and a due reverence <hi>in the firſt place</hi> towards God, whoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we are, then towards ſociety, wherein we live; and then towards our ſelves, whom we ought no leſſe, nay much more to revere, than we doe any others. <hi>But that Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate decoration by Painting and Ceruſſe,</hi> it is well worthy of the imperfections which attend it; being neither fine enough

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>OW let us proceed to the Knowledge which concerns the Mind or Soule of man,</hi> out of the treaſures whereof all other Knowledges are extracted. <hi>It hath two Parts, the one entreateth of the Reaſonable Soule, which is a thing Divine; the other of the unreaſonable Soule, which is common to us with Beaſts.</hi> We have noted a litle before (where we ſpeake of Formes,) thoſe two different <hi>Emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Soules,</hi> which in the firſt Creation of them both, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves unto our view, that is, that one hath it's ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall from the <hi>Breath of God;</hi> the other from the <hi>Matrices of the Elements;</hi> for of the Primitive Emanation of the Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Soule,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> thus ſpeakes the Scripture, <hi>Deus formavit hominem de limo terrae, &amp; ſpiravit infaciem eius ſpiraculum vitae:</hi> But the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:150781:162"/> Generation of the unreaſonable Soule, or of Beaſts, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht by theſe words; <hi>Producat Aqua, Producat Terra:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> And this irrationall Soule, as it is in man, is the Inſtrument only to the <hi>Reaſonable Soule;</hi> and hath the ſame originall in us, that it hath in Beaſts; namely, <hi>from the ſlime of the earth;</hi> for it is not ſaid <hi>God form'd the Body of man, of the ſlime of the Earth, but God formed man,</hi> that is the whole man <hi>that Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> excepted. Wherefore we will ſtile that part of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall knowledge concerning <hi>mans ſoule,</hi> the knowledge of the <hi>ſpiracle, or inſpired ſubſtance;</hi> and the other Part, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>of the Senſible</hi> or <hi>Product Soule.</hi> And ſeeing that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we handle Philoſophie only (placing <hi>ſacred Theologie</hi> in the cloſe of this worke) we would not have borrowed this Partition from <hi>Divinity,</hi> if it had not here concurr'd with the Principles of <hi>Philoſophie. There are many and great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the ſoule of man, above the ſoules of beaſts,</hi> evident unto thoſe who philoſophize even according to ſenſe: And whereſoever the concurrent Characters of ſuch great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies are found, there ſhould ever, upon good reaſon, be made a <hi>ſpecifique Difference.</hi> Wherefore we doe not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo well allow the Philoſophers promiſcuous, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Diſcourſes touching <hi>the Functions of the Soule; as if the Soule of man was differenced gradually, rather than ſpecifiquely; from the ſoule of Beasts;</hi> no otherwiſe than the Sun amongſt the Starres, or Gold amongſt Metals.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>There remaines another partition alſo to be annexed to the knowledge in Generall concerning the ſoule or mind of man,</hi> before we ſpeake at large of the kinds: For what we ſhall ſpeake of the <hi>ſpecies</hi> hereafter, comprehendeth both the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions; as well that which we have ſet downe already, as this which we now ſhall propound. <hi>Wherefore the ſecond Partition may be, into the knowledge concerning the Subſtance and Faculties of the Soule;</hi> and into the knowledge <hi>concerning the uſe and objects of the Faculties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ This two-fold Partition of the Soule thus premis'd, let us now come unto the ſpecies or kinds. The knowledge of the <hi>Spiraculum,</hi> or <hi>inſpired Eſſence,</hi> as that concerning the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:150781:163"/> Subſtance of the Reaſonable Soule, comprehends theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries touching the Naturc thereof; as whether, <hi>it be Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or <hi>Adventive; Separable, or Jnſeparable; Mortall, or Jm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall; how farre it is tied to the Lawes of Matter, how farre, not,</hi> and the like? What other points ſoever there are of this kind, although they may be more diligently, and ſoundly inquired even in Philoſophie, than hitherto they have bin; yet for all this, in our opinion, they muſt be bound over at laſt, unto Religion, there to be determined and defined; for otherwiſe they ſtill lye open to many errors and illuſions of ſenſe.<note place="margin">Animae Origo Myſteriu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                  <hi>For ſeeing that the ſubſtance of the Soule was not deduced and extracted in hir Creation from the Maſſe of Heaven and Earth, but immediatly inſpired from God; and ſeeing the Lawes of of Heaven and Earth are the proper ſubjects of Philoſophie; how can the knowledge of the ſubſtance of the Reaſonable Soule be derived or fetch't from Philoſophy?

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:150781:163"/> contagious opinions, and moſt vilely abaſing, the Dignity of the <hi>ſoule of man;</hi> of <hi>Tranſmigration of ſoules out of one Body into another; and Luſtrations of ſoules by Periods of yeares; and finally of the too neere affinity in every point of the ſoule of man, with the ſouls of beasts.</hi> This ſoule in <hi>Beaſts is a principal ſoule,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the body of Beaſts is the Organ; but <hi>in man this ſoule is it ſelfe an Organ</hi> of the Soule Rationall, and may rather be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the appellation of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> than of a <hi>Soule.</hi> And thus much of the <hi>ſubſtance of the Soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>The Faculties of the Soule are well knowne, to be, Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; Reaſon; Imagination; Memory; Appetite; Will,</hi> and all thoſe Powers, about which the Sciences of <hi>Logique</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thique</hi> are converſant. But in the <hi>knowledge concerning the ſoule, the Originall of theſe Faculties</hi> ought to be handled, and that Phyſically, as they are connaturall with the Soule, and adhere to it: Only their <hi>uſes</hi> and <hi>obiects</hi> are deſigned to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts. And in this Part (in our opinion) there hath bin no extraordinary performance hetherto; although we doe not report it as <hi>Deficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II This Part <hi>touching the Faculties of the Soule</hi> hath <hi>two Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices,</hi> which as they have bin handled have rather preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us with ſmoake, than any lucide flames of truth; one of theſe is the Knowledge of <hi>Naturall Divination;</hi> the other of <hi>Faſcination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Divination</hi> hath bin anciently and fitly divided into two Parts; <hi>Artificiall</hi> and <hi>Naturall. Artificiall</hi> by arguing from the Indication of ſignes, collectes a <hi>Prediction: Naturall</hi> from the internall <hi>Divination</hi> of the mind without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of ſignes, makes a Preſage. <hi>Artificiall is of two ſorts;</hi> one argueth from <hi>Cauſes;</hi> the other from <hi>Experiments</hi> only, by a blind way of Auctoritie; which later is for the moſt part ſuperſtitious, ſuch as was the Heathen Diſcipline upon the <hi>inſpection of the Intrals of Beaſts;</hi> the flight of Birds; and the like: So the ſolemne Aſtrologie of the Chaldeans was litle better. Both the kinds of <hi>Artificiall Divination</hi> are diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongſt diverſe Sciences. The Aſtrologer hath his <hi>Predictions</hi> from the ſituation of the ſtarres; the Phyſitian
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:150781:164"/> hath his <hi>Predictions,</hi> of the approach of Death; of Recovery; of enſuing Symptomes of Diſeaſes; from Vrines; Pulſes; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Patients, and the like. The Politique hath his <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi>

                  <hi>O urbem vaenalem &amp; citò perituram, ſi emptorem invene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> The truth of which <hi>Propheſie</hi> ſtaid not long, being firſt accompliſht in <hi>Sylla,</hi> after in <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Wherefore Predictions of this Nature are not pertinent to the preſent purpoſe, but are to be referred over to their proper Arts. But the <hi>Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Naturall,</hi> which ſpringeth from the internall Power of the Soule, is that which we now ſpeak of. <hi>This is of two ſorts, the one Native; the other by Influxion. Native</hi> is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſuppoſition, <hi>that the mind when it is withdrawne and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected into it ſelfe, and not diffuſed into Organs of the Body, hath from the naturall Power of its owne Eſſence, ſome Prenotion of things future.</hi> And this appeares moſt in ſleepe; Extaſies; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity of Death; more rare, in waking, or when the Body is healthfull and ſtrong. And this ſtate of the mind is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly procured ano furthered by abſtinencies, and thoſe obſervancies which doe moſt of all retire the <hi>Mind</hi> unto it ſelfe from the practique functions of the <hi>Body;</hi> that thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim'd from the incombrances of exterior ingagements, it may poſſeſſe and enjoy its owne Nature. <hi>But Divination by Jnfluxion</hi> is grounded upon another ſuppoſition, <hi>That the Mind as a Mirror or Glaſſe ſhould take a ſecondary kind of Jllu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination from the fore-knowledge of God and Spirits; unto which the ſame State and Regiment of the Body which was to the firſt, doth likewiſe conduce.</hi> For the ſame ſequeſtration of the mind cauſeth it more ſeverely to imploy its owne Eſſence; and makes it more ſuſceptive of <hi>Divine Influxions:</hi> ſave that the ſoule, in <hi>Divinations by Influxion</hi> is rapt with a kind of fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency and impatiency, as it were of the Deitie, wherewith it is poſſeſt (which the Ancients noted by the name of <hi>ſacred Fury;</hi> but in <hi>Native Divination,</hi> the mind is enfranchis'd and neerer to a repoſe rather, and an immunity from labour.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Faſcination is the Power and intenſive Act of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the Bodie of another,</hi> (for of the Power of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination</hi> upon the Body of the imaginant, we have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:150781:164"/> before). In this kind the <hi>ſchoole of Paracelſus,</hi> and the Diſciples of pretended <hi>Naturall Magique,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Par. In Param.</note> have bin ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, as they have only not equall'd the force and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the <hi>Imagination,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Crollij Praef.</note> with the power of <hi>miracle-working faith.</hi> Others, drawing neerer to the ſimilitude of truth, when they had more intentively conſidered the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret energies and impreſſions of things; the Irradiations of the ſenſes; the tranſmiſſions of cogitations from Body to Body; the conveyances of Magnetique virtues; came to be of opinion, that much more might ſuch Impreſſions; Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; and Communications be made, from ſpirit to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; being that a ſpirit of all other things is more powerfull and ſtrong to worke, and more ſoft and penetrable to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: whence the conceits have growne, made almoſt popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare, of the Maſtering ſpirit; of men ominous and unlucky; of the ſtrokes of love and envy; and of others of like Nature. Incident unto this, is the enquiry, <hi>How the Imagination may be intended and fortified?</hi> For if the <hi>Imagination</hi> fortified be of ſuch great power, then it is materiall to know by what waies it may be exalted, and made greater than it ſelfe? And here comes in crookedly, and as dangerouſly, a Palliation and Defence of a great part of <hi>Ceremoniall Magique.</hi> For it may be a ſpecious pretence that Ceremonies; Characters; Charmes; Geſticulations; Amulets, and the like, <hi>doe worke not by any tacite or ſacramentall contract with evill ſpirits; but ſerve only to ſtrengthen and exalt the imagination of him that uſeth them; even as the uſe of Jmages in religion hath prevail'd for the fixing of mens minds in the Contemplation of things, and the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the devotion of them that Pray.</hi> But for my owne judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if it be admitted, that the force of <hi>Imagination</hi> is ſo Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that Ceremonies exalt and fortifie that Power; and be it granted, that Ceremonies are uſed ſincerely to that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, &amp; as a Phyſicall Remedy, without the leaſt thought of inviting the aſiſtance of Spirits by them; yet, for all this, I ſhould hold them unlawfull, becauſe they impugne and contradict that divine Edict paſs'd upon man for ſinne, <hi>In ſudore vultus comedes panem tuum.</hi>

But now it is knowne to be a corporall and materiate Subſtance, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be enquired, by what efforts ſuch a puſill and a thin-ſoft aire ſhould put in motion, ſuch ſolid and hard bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Therefore ſeeing this part is DEFICIENT let <hi>enquiry</hi> be made thereof.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>But of ſenſe and ſenſibility</hi> there hath bin made a farre more plentifull and diligent enquiry, both in Generall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes about them, and in Particular Sciences; as in <hi>Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,</hi> and <hi>Muſique;</hi> how truly, is not to our purpoſe to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Wherefore we cannot ſet them downe as DEFICIENTS:
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:150781:165"/> 
                  <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> there are two noble and remarkable Parts, which in this knowledge we aſſigne to be DEFICIENT; the one concerning <hi>the difference of Perception and Senſe;</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning the <hi>Forme</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  <note n="✿" place="margin">DE DIFFE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENTIA PERCEP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONIS ET SENSVS</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for the Difference between Perception and Senſe,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſhould in their writings <hi>de ſenſu &amp; ſenſibili</hi> have premis'd a ſolid and ſound diſcovery thereof, as a matter Fundamentall. For we ſee that there is a manifeſt power of <hi>Perception</hi> even in all Bodies Naturall; and a kind of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to embrace that which is any way allied in nature, and favourable to them; and to fly what is adverſe and forraine. Neither doe we meane of more ſubtile <hi>Perceptions</hi> only, <hi>as when the Loadstone drawes unto it Iron; Flame leapes to Bitumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Mould;</hi> one Buble of water neere another Buble, cloſeth and incorporates with it; Rayes glance from a white ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the body of a living Creature aſſimilates that which is good for it, excerneth what is unprofitable; a peece of ſponge even when it is rais'd above the ſurface of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſucks in water, expells ayre; and the like.

Why Aliments are digeſted, egeſted: Humors and ſucculent moyſtures caried upwards and downwards; the Heart and Pulſe beate; the Guts as ſo many Shops, or Worke-houſes ſhould every one accompliſh his proper worke, and yet all theſe and many ſuch like are performed without <hi>Senſe?</hi> But men have not with ſufficient enquiry ſearcht or found out of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the Action of <hi>Senſe</hi> is; and what kind of Body; what delay; what Conduplication of impreſſion are required to this, that pain or pleaſure ſhould follow? To cloſe this point they doe ſeem to be altogether ignorant of the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>ſimple Perception and ſenſe; how farre Perception may be made without ſenſe?</hi> Nor is this Enquiry a Controverſie of words, but a matter of great and important moment. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let</hi> there be made a better <hi>inquiry</hi> of this knowledge, as of a matter very profitable, and of manifold uſe.

               </p>
               <p>§ Secondly if this which we affirme, be well conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is demonſtrated by the <hi>Forme of Induction</hi> which Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gique propounds, namely by that <hi>Forme of inference,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Principles of Sciences are found out and proved; which, as it is now framed, is utterly vitious and incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and ſo farre from perfecting nature that it rather per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts and diſtorts it. For he that ſhall exactly obſerve how
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:150781:171"/> this <hi>Aethereall Dew of Sciences;</hi> like unto that the Poet ſpeaks of <hi>Aerei mellis Caeleſtia dona</hi> is gather'd (ſeeing that even Sciences themſelves are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted out of particular examples, partly Naturall, partly Artificiall; or from the flowers of the field, and Garden) ſhall find that the mind of hir owne nature, and imbred diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth more ingeniouſly, and with better Invention, Act an <hi>Induction,</hi> than Logicians deſcribe it. For from a <hi>nude e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration of Particulars</hi> (as Logicians uſe to doe) without an Inſtance Contradictory, is a vitious Concluſion; nor doth ſuch an <hi>Induction</hi> inferre more than a probable Conjecture. For who will take upon him, when the Particulars which a man knowes, and which he hath mention'd, appeare only on one ſide, there may not lurke ſome Particular which is altogither repugnant? As if <hi>Samuell</hi> ſhould have reſted in thoſe ſons of <hi>Iſhay</hi> which were brought before him in the houſe; and ſhould not have ſought <hi>David</hi> which was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the field. And this <hi>Forme of Induction</hi> (to ſay plainly the truth) is ſo groſſe and palpable, that it might ſeeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, that ſuch acute and ſubtile wits as have exerciz'd their meditations in theſe things, could have obtruded it upon the world; but that they haſted to Theories, and Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticalls; and from a kind of pride and elation of mind deſpiſed <hi>Particulars,</hi> ſpecially any long ſtay upon them. <hi>For they have uſed theſe examples and Particular Inſtances, but as Sergeants, and whifflers, ad ſummovendam turbam, to make way and roome for their opinions; and never advis'd with them from the beginning, that ſo a legitimate and mature deliberation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth of things, might be made.</hi> Certainly it is a thing hath touch'd my mind with a pious, and religious wonder, to ſee the ſame ſteps leading to error, trodden in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane enquiries. For as in the apprehending of divine truth, men cannot endure to become as a child; ſo in the apprehending of humane truth, for men, come to yeares, yet to read, and repeate, the firſt Elements <hi>of Inductions,</hi> as if they were ſtill children; is reputed a poore and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble imployment.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:150781:172"/>
               <p>§ Thirdly if it be granted, that the <hi>Principles</hi> of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may be rightly inferr'd from the <hi>Induction,</hi> which they uſe, or from ſenſe and experience; yet nevertheleſſe, certaine it is, that inferior Axioms, cannot rightly and ſafely be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, by Syllogiſme from them, in things of nature, which participate of matter. For in <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> there is a reduction of Propoſitions to <hi>Principles</hi> by middle Propoſitions. And this Forme, whether for <hi>Invention,</hi> or for <hi>Proofe,</hi> in Sciences Popular, as <hi>Ethiques; Politiques; Lawes,</hi> and the like takes place; yea, and in Divinity; ſeeing it hath pleaſed God of his goodneſſe to accommodate himſelfe to mans capacitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in Naturall Philoſophy where nature ſhould be convinc'd and vanquiſht by deeds, and not an Adverſary, by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; truth plainly eſcapes our hands: <hi>becauſe that the ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the operations of Nature, is farre greater than the ſubtlety of words.</hi> So that the <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> thus failing, there is every way need of helpe and ſervice, of true and rectified <hi>Induction,</hi> as well for the more generall Principles, as inferior Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>For Syllogiſmes</hi> conſiſt of Propoſitions, Propoſitions of words, words are the currant tokens or markes of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of things; wherefore <hi>if theſe Notions (which are the ſoules of words)</hi> be groſſely, and variably abſtracted from things, the whole building falls. Neither is it the laborious examination either of Conſequences, Arguments, or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Propoſitions, that can ever repaire that ruine; being the error is, as the Phyſitians ſpeake, in the <hi>first Digeſtion;</hi> which is not rectified by the ſequent functions of Nature. And therefore it was not without great and evident Cauſe, that many of the Philoſophers, and of them, ſome of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar note, became <hi>Academiques;</hi> and <hi>Sceptiques;</hi> which took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all <hi>certainty of knowledge</hi> or of <hi>Comprehenſions;</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that the knowledge of man extended further than ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence and probability. It is true that ſome are of opinion, that <hi>Socrates,</hi> when he put off certainty of ſcience from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<note place="margin">Cic. in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad.</note> did this but by a forme of <hi>Irony, &amp; ſcientiam diſsimulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſimulaſſe;</hi> that is that by renouncing thoſe things which he manifeſtly knew, he might be reputed to know even that
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:150781:172"/> which he knew not; neither in the later Academy which <hi>Cicero</hi> imbraced was this opinion of <hi>Acatalepſie</hi> held ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely: For all thoſe which excell'd for eloquence,<note place="margin">In Acad. Q.</note> common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made choice of this Sect, as fitter to give glory to their copious ſpeech, and variable diſcourſe both wayes; which was the cauſe they turn'd aſide from that ſtraight way by which they ſhould have gone on to truth, to pleaſant walks made for delight and paſtime. <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> it appeares that there were many ſcatter'd in both Academies, the old and new (much more among the <hi>Sceptiques</hi>) that held this <hi>Acatalepſie</hi> in ſimplicitie and integritie: But here was their chiefe error, that they charged the <hi>Perceptions</hi> of the <hi>Senſes,</hi> whereby they did extirpate and pluck up Sciences by the roots. For the ſenſes although they many times deſtitute, and deceive men, yet aſſiſted by much induſtry they may be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Sciences; and that not ſo much by the helpe of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> (though theſe are in ſome ſort uſefull) as of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments of the ſame kind, which may produce more ſubtile objects, than, for the facultie of ſenſe, are by ſenſe compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible. And they ought rather to have charged the defects in this kind upon the errors, and contumacie of the mind, which refuſeth to be pliant and morigerous to the Nature of things; and to crooked demonſtrations and rules of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and concluding, ill ſet downe and propounded from the <hi>Perception of Senſe.</hi> This we ſpeake not to diſable the mind of man; or that the buſineſſe ſhould be abandoned; but that apt and proper aſſiſtances may be acquired; and applied to the underſtanding, whereby men may ſubdue the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of things, and the obſcurity of Nature. <hi>For no man hath ſuch a ſteadineſſe of hand by nature or Practiſe, that he can draw a ſtraight line or make a perfect circle with his hand at liberty, which yet is eaſily done by rule or compaſſe.</hi> This is that very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe which we goe about and with great paines endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>that the mind by the helpe of Art might be able to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Nature;</hi> and that there might be found out an Art of Diſcovery, or Direction, which might diſcloſe, and bring to light other Arts, and their Axiomes and Workes.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ariation</hi> of <hi>Experience</hi> is firſt practis'd upon <hi>Matter;</hi> that is when the <hi>Experiment</hi> in things already knowne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:150781:173"/> adheareth to ſuch a <hi>kind of matter;</hi> and now it is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in other things of like kind; as the <hi>making of Papyr</hi> is only tried in linnen, &amp; not in ſilk, (unleſſe perchance amongſt the Chineſes; nor yet in ſtuffes intermixt with haire and briſtles, of which is made that which we call chame-lot; nor yet in woolen, cotton, and skins, although theſe three laſt ſeeme to be more Heterogeneous, and ſo rather may become uſefull mingled, than ſeparate: So inſition in fruit-Trees, is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd, but rarely tried in Trees-wild; although it is affirm'd that an Elme grafted upon an Elme, will produce wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſhades of leaves. Inſition likewiſe in flowers is very rare, though now the Experiment begins to be made upon musk-Roſes, which are ſucceſſefully inoculate upon common Roſes. So we place the <hi>variation in the Part of a thing amongſt the variations in Matter.</hi> For we ſee a ſcion, or young ſlip graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the trunck of a tree, to ſhoot forth more proſperou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, than if it had bin ſet in earth: And why, in like manner, ſhould not the ſeed of an Onion inſerted into the head of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Onion while it is green, germinate more happily than if it had bin ſowen in the bare earth? And here the <hi>Root</hi> is varied for the <hi>Trunck,</hi> that the thing may ſeeme to be a kind of inſition in the root. <hi>Secondly, the variation of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment may be made in the efficient:</hi> The <hi>beames of the Sun</hi> through burning-Glaſſes are ſo fortified, and intended to ſuch a degree of heate, that they are able to ſet on flame any matter, which is apt eaſily to conceive fire: Now whether <hi>may the beames of the Moone,</hi> by the ſame Glaſſes be actuated by ſome weake degrees of warmth; that we may ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all heavenly Bodies be hot in power? So <hi>bright and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diant heates</hi> are exalted by Glaſſes: Whether are <hi>gloomy and opaque heates</hi> (as of ſtones and metals, before they be made burning hot by the force of fire) ſubject to the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; or are they rather in this ſome portions of light? So Amber, and Iet, or an Agat, chaffed draw unto them ſtraw; whether warmed at the fire will they doe the like? <hi>Thirdly, the variation of an Experiment may be made in Quantity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which a very diligent care is to be taken being it
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:150781:174"/> is encompaſſed with many errors. For men are of opinion <hi>that if the Quantity be augmented and multiplied, the virtue is proportionably augmented and multiplied;</hi> and this commonly is with them a Poſtulatum, and a ſuppoſed truth, as if the matter were a Mathematicall certitude; which is utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. <hi>A globe of Lead, or a pound in waight</hi> let fal from a Tower, ſay it deſcends to the earth in the ſpace of ten Pulſes; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will <hi>a Globe of two pound waight</hi> (in which that force of Motion, which they call Naturall, ſhould be doubled,) light upon the earth in the ſpace of five Pulſes? But that Globe ſhall come downe almoſt in an equall ſpace of time with this, and ſhall not be accelerated according to the meaſure of <hi>Quantity.</hi> So (imagine,) one dragme of Sulphur mingled with halfe a pound of Steele, it will make it fluid and liquid; Will therefore an ounce of Sulphur ſuffice to the diſſolving of foure pounds of Steele? But that followes not; <hi>For it is certaine that the obſtinacy of the matter in the Patient is more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by Quantity, than the Activity of the virtue in the Agent.</hi> Beſides, too much, as well a too litle fruſtrates the effect: For in the excoctions and depurations of Metalls it is a familiar error, that to advance excoction, they augment the heate of the Fornace, or the <hi>Quantity of the Jniection;</hi> but if theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed due proportion, they hinder the operation; becauſe through their force and acrimony, they turne much of the pure Metall into fumes, and carry it away; ſo as there is a loſſe in the Metall; and the maſſe which remaines through the emiſſion of the Spitits becomes more obſtinate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate.<note place="margin">Aeſop.

                  <hi>Men ſhould</hi> therefore remember the mockery of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopes</hi> huſwife, who conceited that by doubling hir meaſure of Barley, hir Hen would daily lay hir two egges; But the Hen grew fat and laid none. Jt is not altogither ſafe to rely upon any Naturall experiment, before proofe be made <hi>both in a leſſer, and greater Quantity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Production of an Experiment is of two ſorts, Repetition and Extenſion; namely when the Experiment either is iterated; or driven to a kind of ſubtiltie.</hi> Example of <hi>Repetition</hi> may be this; <hi>the ſpirit of wine</hi> is made of wine once diſtilled, and it is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:150781:174"/> much more quick and ſtrong than wine it ſelfe; will like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ſpirit it ſelfe of wine diſtilled, or ſublimated, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably exceed it ſelfe in ſtrength? <hi>But Repetition</hi> alſo is not without deceit; for neither doth the ſecond exaltation equal the exceſſe of the firſt; and many times by <hi>iteration of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment</hi> after a certaine ſtate, and height of operation, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſo farre from a further progreſſion, as ſhe rather falls into a relapſe. Wherefore the <hi>experiment</hi> muſt be made with Caution and judgment. So <hi>Quickſilver</hi> in linnen, or elſe in the midſt of moulten Lead when it begins to grow cold the Quickſilver inferted is ſtupified, and is no longer fluid; Will the ſame <hi>Quickſilver</hi> if it be often ſo practis'd upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo fixt as to be made malleable? The example of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion may be this, <hi>water placed upwards,</hi> and made penſile; and by a long neb of a glaſſe dipt in wine, mixt with water, will unmingle, the water from the wine, the wine leaſurely aſcending, and ſetling in the top; the water deſcending, and ſetling in the bottome: Now as wine and water which are two diverſe bodies are ſeparate by this deviſe; may the more ſubtile parts of wine in like manner, which is an en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tire body, be ſeparate from the more groſſe, that ſo there may be a diſtillation, as it were, by weight; and that there may be found floating in the top, a ſubſtance neereſt to the ſpirit of wine, but perchance more delicate? So the Load-ſtone draweth Iron ſolid, and entire, unto it; will a piece of a Load-ſtone, plonged into diſſolv'd parcels and fragments of Iron, allure the Iron unto it, and cover it ſelfe with it? So <hi>the verſor of a Mariners needle</hi> applies it ſelfe to the Poles of the world: Doth it doe this after the ſame manner, and upon the ſame conſequence whereby Celeſtiall Bodies move? Namely if you ſhould place the Needle in a contrary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that is, in the South-point, and there ſtay it a while, and then ceaſe your forcing it, and leave it to it ſelfe; would this <hi>Needle</hi> turne it ſelfe perchance to the North; and chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to wheele about by the Weſt into its deſired-naturall ſite, than by the Eaſt? <hi>So gold imbibeth</hi> Quickſilver which is contiguous to it; doth the gold ingulfe, and ſuck up this
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:150781:175"/> Quickſilver into it ſelfe without extenſion of its ſubſtance, that it becomes a Maſſe more ponderous than gold it ſelfe? <hi>So ſome men ſubminiſter helpes to their memories</hi> by ſetting up Images and Pictures of Perſons in certaine roomes; would they attaine the ſame end, if (ſetting aſide ſuch Images) they ſhould effigiate to themſelves an Idea of their geſts and habits. And thus much of the Poduction of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The tranſlation of an experiment is three-fold, either from Nature, or chance into Art; or from Art, or one Practice into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or from a part of ſome Art, into a diverſe part of the ſame Art. Of Tranſlation from Nature, or chance into Art,</hi> there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable examples; for that almoſt all Mechanicall Arts owe their originalls from ſlender beginnings preſented by <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Chance.</hi> It is a receiv'd Proverb, <hi>That Grapes conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Grapes ſooner come to maturity:</hi> Which from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mutuall aſſiſtance and friendſhip grew popular. But our makers of Cyder, which is a wine or Apples, doe well imitate this: For they provide that they be not ſtampt or preſt, before, by being caſt into heapes for a time, they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by mutuall contact; whereby the acidity and tartneſſe of the liquor is corrected. So the <hi>imitation of Artificiall Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowes</hi> by the ſpiſſe aſperſion of litle drops, is by an eaſy deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from naturall Rain-bowes compoſed of a dewy Cloud. <hi>So the manner of distilling</hi> might be taken either from above, as from ſhowers or dew; or from that homely expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment of Drops adhearing to Covers put upon Pots of boyling water.<note place="margin">Pancirollus par. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>And a man would have bin affeard to have imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Thunder and Lightning, if the Potlid of that chymique Monke had not by being toſt up into the ayre, inſtructed him.</hi> But the more plentifull <hi>this experiment</hi> is of examples, the fewer we need to produce. And if men would be at leaſure to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their ſtudies in the inquiry of things profitable; they ſhould view attentively, by degrees and of ſet purpoſe all the workmanſhip, and the particular workings of Nature; and perpetually, and thoroughly meditate with themſelves, which of thoſe may be transferr'd to Arts, <hi>For Nature is the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150781:175"/> Mirror of Art:</hi> And the experiments are as many which may be <hi>tranſlated from Art into Art; or from one Practice into another,</hi> though this is not ſo much in uſe: For nature every way is obvious to all men; but Arts appropriate to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Profeſſors, are only knowne to them. <hi>Spectacles</hi> are invented to helpe a weake ſight; might there be contrived a inſtrument which faſtned to the eare, might helpe ſuch as are thick of hearing? So <hi>embalming, and hony conſerve dead Corps;</hi> might not ſome of thoſe ingredients be transferr'd into a medicine, which might be uſefull to bodies alive? So the practice of Seales upon wax; cements for walls, and upon Lead is ancient; but this invention ſhewed the way to Impreſſion upon Paper, or the Art of Printing. <hi>So in the Art of Cookerie ſalt ſeaſons fleſh,</hi> and that better in Winter, than in Summer: Might not this be profitably tranſlated to Bathes and their temperament, as occaſion ſhall require; either to impreſſe ſome good moiſture, or extract ſome peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. <hi>So ſalt</hi> in the new-found experiment of <hi>Artificiall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaciations</hi> is found to have great power to condenſe: Might not this be transferr'd to the condenſation of Metalls; ſeeing it is knowne long ſince that ſtrong-waters being compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of ſome kinds of ſalts, have a power to deject and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate ſmall ſands of Gold out of certaine Metalls, not ſo denſe and compact as Gold? <hi>So painting revives the memorie of a thing, by the Jmage of a Picture:</hi> Is not this traduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an Art, which they call <hi>the Art of Memorie?</hi> Let this in generall ſerve for admonition; that nothing can ſo much conduce to the drawing downe, as it were, from heaven, a whole ſhowre of new and profitable Inventions, as this, that the experiments of many Mechanique Arts, may come to the knowledge of one man, or ſome few, who by mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conference may whet and ſharpen one another; that ſo by this which we call <hi>Tranſlation of Experiments,</hi> Arts may nouriſh, and, as it were, by a commixture, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Rayes, inflame one the other. For although the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall way by an artificiall <hi>Organum,</hi> promiſe farre greater matters; yet nevertheleſſe this <hi>ſagacitie by literate experience,</hi>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:150781:176"/> may in the meane project and ſcatter to the benefit of man (as miſſive Donatives amongſt the Ancients) many rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to knowledge, which may be had at hand. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the Tranſlation of a Part of Art into another part diverſe from it,</hi> which litle differs from the <hi>Tranſlation of Art into Art:</hi> But becauſe many <hi>Arts</hi> exerciſe great ſpaces, ſo as they may very well ſuſtaine a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> within the limits of their owne operations; we thought good to annex this kind of <hi>Tranſlation;</hi> ſpecially ſeeing it is in ſome Arts of very great import. For it maketh much to the advancement and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Art of Phyſique; if the <hi>Experiments</hi> of that part of Medicine <hi>concerning the Cures of Diſeaſes,</hi> be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to thoſe Parts concerning the <hi>Regiment of Health,</hi> and the <hi>Prolongation of Life.</hi> For if ſome excellent <hi>Opiate</hi> be of that force and virtue, as to repreſſe and aſſwage the raging inflamation of the ſpirits, in a peſtilentiall Fever; let no man queſtion, but that a like receipt by a due proportioned Doſe made familiar, may in ſome degree put back and retard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation which growes and creepes upon us by age. Thus much for the <hi>Tranſlation of Experiments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Inverſion of Experiment</hi> is, when the contrary to that which is by <hi>Experiment</hi> manifeſt, is tried: For example, <hi>Heat by Glaſſes is intended;</hi> is cold ſo too? So <hi>Heate</hi> when it diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it ſelfe is yet rather caried upwards: Is cold likewiſe in diffuſing it ſelfe caried rather downwards? For inſtance, take a ſmall Barre of Iron, and heate it on one end, then ſet it upright, (that end which is heated placed downwards) laying your hand upon the end, it will preſently burne your hand; but now inverſe the Barre, placeing the hot part up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and your hand upon the part which is downwards, and you ſhall not feele the heate ſo ſoone by many Pulſes: Whether or no if the Barre was heated all over, and one end ſhould be moiſtned with ſnow, or with a ſponge dipt in cold water; if the ſnow or ſponge were applied to the part which is upward, would (I ſay) the cold ſooner pierce downward, than if the ſnow or ſponge placed at the lower end, the cold would ſhoote upward. <hi>So the Beams of the Sun</hi>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:150781:176"/> rebound from a white, upon a black are congregate: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſhadowes alſo diſperſed upon white, and united upon black? The Experiment we ſee made in a dark room, the light being let in thorow a narrow chinck only, where the Images of things which are without, are taken upon white Paper, not upon black. So a veine is opened in the fore-head for the Megrim, or Head-ach. Muſt alſo the Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craine be ſcarified for the <hi>Soda;</hi> or the paine of the head in generall? So much for the <hi>Jnverſion of Experiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Compulſion of Experiment, is when Experiment is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and extended to annihilation, or privation of the vertue.</hi> For in other kinds of hunting, the game is only taken, but in this kill'd. Example of <hi>Compulſion</hi> is this; <hi>The Loadſtone drawes Iron,</hi> in force therefore the Iron, or vexe the Loadſtone, ſo, as the virtue of attraction be ſtifled or expir'd: As, ſuppoſe the Loadſtone were burnt or macerate in ſtrong-waters, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it forgoe, or abate its virtue? Contrariwiſe <hi>if steele,</hi> or Iron be reduced <hi>in Crocum Martis,</hi> or into prepar'd ſteel, as they call it; or be diſſolved in <hi>Aqua-fortis;</hi> will the Loadſtone ſtill allure them? <hi>Again, the Loadſtone</hi> draws Iron through all interpos'd Bodies that we know, as Gold; Silver; Glaſſe, &amp;c. Fixe therefore ſome medium upon it (if it may be) that may intercept, and arreſt its virtue. Make a triall of Quickſilver; of Oyle; Gummes; a burning coale; and the like, which yet have not bin experimented. <hi>So there have</hi> bin brought in of late, <hi>certaine Perſpectives</hi> which multiply after a ſtrange manner the minuteſt viſibles: Preſſe the uſe of them, either upon ſmall objects, as they may not be able to worke upon; or upon ſo vaſt, as they may be confounded in working: As whether they can cleerly diſcover thoſe moates in Urin, which otherwaies could not be diſcern'd? Whether in Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, every way pure and ſpotleſſe, they can make the graines and imperceptible clouds to become viſible? <hi>Whether</hi> can they expoſe to view the moates in the Sun (which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely charged upon <hi>Democritus</hi> for his Atomes,<note place="margin">Hippoc. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Laert. in vita Plin. Lib. 30.</note> and the Principles of Nature) as if they were great Bodies? Can they ſo diſtinguiſh to the ſight the groſſer duſt made of Ceruſſe,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:150781:177"/> and Vermillion, that the ſmall graines may appeare; here the red, there the white? <hi>Againe, can</hi> they multiply greater Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures (imagine a face; an eye, or ſo) to the ſame bigneſſe they can a flea, or a litle worme? <hi>Can they</hi> make a piece of Cypres, or Cobweb-Lawne appeare ſo full of holes, as if it were a Net? <hi>But we ſtay</hi> the leſſe upon the <hi>Compulſions of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> becauſe commonly they fall not within the limits of literate experience; but are rather referr'd to <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and <hi>Axioms;</hi> and the <hi>New Organum.</hi> For whereſoever there is a Negative; Privative; or excluſive facultie; there is already ſome light given to the <hi>Invention of Formes.</hi> Thus farre of the <hi>Compulſion of Experiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Application of Experiment is nothing elſe than a witty Tranſlation of it to ſome other profitable Experiment.</hi> Example may be this; All Bodies have their owne dimenſions, and their owne weights: Gold is of greater weight, of leſſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion, than Silver; Water than Wine. From this is tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a profitable Experiment; that from a juſt weight and meaſure being taken, you may know how much Silver hath bin mixt with Gold; how much Water with Wine; which was that celebrated <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of Archimedes. So fleſh ſooner putrifies in ſome Cellers, than it doth in others. It will be of uſe to make application of this <hi>Experiment</hi> to the finding out of Aires, more or leſſe healthfull, for habitation; namely, there where fleſh is longeſt preſerv'd from putrefaction. The ſame may be applied to the diſcovery of healthfull, or peſtilentiall ſeaſons of the yeare. <hi>But there</hi> are innumerable examples of this Nature: Only let men awake, and pepetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixe their eyes, one while, on the nature of things; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while, on the application of them to the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of mankind. So much concerning the <hi>Application of Experiment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Copulation of Experiment is the Linkes and Chaine of Application; when as things, ſingle, and ſeparate had bin to litle uſe, are, (connexed) of force and efficacy.</hi> For example, you deſire to have late Roſes or fruit, this is effected if you pull off the more early buds when they are newly knotted; the ſame is
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:150781:177"/> done, if you lay the roots bare untill the ſpring be well come on, and expoſe them unto the open Aire; but it will take the better, if you joyne both theſe practiſes of putting back germination. So Ice and Nitre doe much conduce to refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geration; but commixt togither much more. But this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment is cleere of it ſelfe, notwithſtanding here may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly a fallacy lie hid, (as there may in all other effects, and concluſions where Axioms are wanting) if the <hi>Copulation</hi> be made of things which worke after a different, and as it were, repugnant manner. And ſo much for <hi>Copulation of Experiment,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>There remaine the Chances, or Fortunes of Experiment. This is altogether an irrationall, &amp; as it were, a paſsionate manner of experimenting, when you have a mind to try a concluſion not for that any reaſon, or other Experiment induceth you to it; but only becauſe the like was never attempted before.</hi> Yet I doe not know whether or no, in this kind, there may not lie hid ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of great uſe, if you trie nature every way. <hi>For the</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Nature commonly lie out of the high roade, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten paths; ſo as the very abſurdity of an attempt may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be proſperous. But if reaſon goe along with this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; that is, that it is evident that ſuch an Experiment was never yet tried; and yet there is great reaſon why it ſhould be attempted; then it is a choice <hi>Experiment,</hi> and ſearcheth the very boſome of Nature. <hi>For example:</hi> In the operation of fire upon ſome Naturall Body, one or other of theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects hitherto ever comes to paſſe; as that either ſomething flies out, (as flame and fume in ordinary burning fewell) or at leaſt there is made a locall ſeparation of Parts, and that for ſome diſtance; as in Diſtillation where the lees ſettle, the vapours, after they have play'd about, are gathered into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles: But no man ever yet made triall of an Impriſon'd Diſtillation, for ſo we may call it: And it ſeemes very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that if the force of heat immur'd within the Cloiſters of a body, doe ſuch great matters, and worke ſuch alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and yet without loſſe, or manumiſſion to the Body; that then this Proteus of matter, fetter'd as it were, with Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:150781:178"/> may in time be forced to many transformations, if ſo be, that the heat be ſo temper'd; and intermutually chang'd, that the veſſels be not broken. <hi>For this</hi> operation is like that of the wombe, where the heat workes without emiſſion, or ſeparation of any part of the Body, ſave that in the Matrix, there is conjoyn'd Alimentation; but for verſion, the thing is the ſame. Theſe are the <hi>fortunes, or adventures of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the meane,</hi> we give this adviſe, touching Experiments of this Nature; that no man be diſcouraged, or confounded if the <hi>Experiments</hi> which he puts in practice anſwer not his expectation: <hi>For what ſucceeds pleaſeth more; but what ſucceeds not, many times informes no leſſe.</hi> And this ought ever to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred (which we often preſſe) <hi>that Experimenta Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Experiments of Light, &amp; diſcovery, ought for a time to be much more enquired after, than Experimenta fructifera Experiments of uſe and practice.</hi> And thus much of <hi>Literate Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> which (as we have ſaid before) is rather a ſagacity, and a hunting ſent, than a Science.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Now for the Novum Organum,</hi> we ſay nothing, nor give any fore-taſt thereof; being we have projected in our minds, by the aſſiſtance of the Divine favour, to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect entire work of that ſubject; ſeeing it is a matter of high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſequence, than all the reſt.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Nvention of Arguments, is not properly an Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for to Invent is to diſcover things unknowne, and not to recover, or recall that which is knowne already. The Vſe and Office of this kind of Invention ſeemes to be no other, than out of the Maſſe of Knowledge, congeſted, and ſtored up in the Mind, readily to produce, that which may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Matter, and Queſtion propounded.</hi> For he that is litle or nothing acquainted before hand with the Subject in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>Topiques of Jnvention</hi> will litle advantage him: On the contrary he that hath Proviſion at home which may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the purpoſe, even without <hi>Art</hi> &amp; <hi>Places of Invention,</hi> will at length, (though not ſo readily and aptly) find out and produce Arguments. <hi>So that this kind of Invention (as we have ſaid) is not properly Invention, but only a Reduction into Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or ſuggeſtion with Application.</hi> But becauſe cuſtome &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hath authoriz'd the word, it may in ſome ſort be called <hi>Inventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For it</hi> may be as wel accompted a chaſe, or finding of a Deere, which is made within an incloſed Park; as that within a Forreſt at large. But ſetting aſide curioſity of words it may appeare that the ſcope and end of this kind of <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> is a certaine promptitude, and expedite uſe of our Knowledge; rather than any encreaſe, or Amplification thereof.</p>
               <p>I <hi>To procure this ready Proviſion for diſcourſe, there are two waies; either that it may be deſigned and pointed out, as it were, by an Jndex, under what Heads the matter is to be ſought; and this is that we call Topique: Or elſe that Arguments may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:150781:179"/> hand framed, and ſtored up, about ſuch things as are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incident, and come into diſceptation; and this we will call prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuarie Art, or of Preparation.</hi> This later ſcarcely deſerveth to be called a <hi>Part of Knowledge,</hi> ſeeing it rather conſiſteth in diligence,<note place="margin">De Repr. Soph. lib. 2. c. 9. §. ult.</note> than any artificiall erudition. And in this part <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> doth wittily indeed, but hurtfully deride the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſts neare his time, ſaying; <hi>They did as if one that profeſſed the Art of ſhoo-making, ſhould not teach how to make up a ſhooe; but only exhibite in a readineſſe a number of ſhooes, of all faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſizes.</hi> But yet a man might here reply, that if a Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker ſhould have no ſhooes in his ſhop, but only work as he is beſpoken, he would be but a poore man, and weakly cuſtomed.

                  <hi>Every Scribe inſtructed for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, is like a good houſholder that bringeth forth both new and old ſtore.</hi> And we ſee the ancient Writers of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique doe give it in Precept, <hi>That Pleaders ſhould have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe common Places prepared long before hand, and handled,</hi> and illuſtrated both waies; for example, For the ſenſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of Law againſt the words,<note place="margin">Cic. de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</note> and letter of Law; and on the contrary. And <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelfe being broken unto it by great experience, delivers it plainly; <hi>That an Orator if he be diligent and ſedulous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ad Attic. Lib. XVI. EP. VI.</note> 
                  <hi>may have in effect premeditate, and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, whatſoever a man ſhall have occaſion to ſpeake of;</hi> ſo that in the Pleading of the Cauſe it ſelfe he ſhall have no need to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert any new or ſodaine matter, beſides new names, and ſome individuall Circumſtances. <hi>But</hi> the paines and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> went ſo farre, that in regard of the great force that the entrance and acceſſe into a Cauſe hath to make a good Impreſſion upon the Minds of Auditors, he thought it worth his labour to frame,<note place="margin">Ejus 65 Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordia, ſi ejus</note> and to have in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe a number of <hi>Prefaces</hi> for Orations and Speeches.

And ſeeing it is common
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:150781:179"/> to both <hi>Logique</hi> and <hi>Rhetorique,</hi> we thought good here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amongſt <hi>Logiques,</hi> only in Paſſage, to touch it; referring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a more ample handling of it to <hi>Rhetorique.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II The other Part of <hi>Invention, which is Topique, we will divide into Generall and Particular Topique.</hi> Generall <hi>is that which is diligently and copiouſly handled in Logique, or rationall knowledge;</hi> as it were needleſſe to ſtay upon the explication thereof. Yet thus much we thought meet to admoniſh by the way; that this <hi>Topique</hi> is of uſe, not only in argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when we come to diſpute with another; but in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations alſo, when we reaſon and debate matters within our ſelves. Neither doe theſe places ſerve only for <hi>ſuggeſtion,</hi> or <hi>admonition,</hi> what we ought to <hi>affirme</hi> or <hi>aſſert;</hi> but alſo what we ought to <hi>inquire</hi> and <hi>demand.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In Meno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne.</note> And a facultie of wiſe interrogating, is halfe a knowledge; for <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith well, <hi>Whoſoever ſeekes, comprehends that he ſeekes, for, in generall notion; elſe how ſhall he know it, when he hath found it? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the larger and more certaine our anticipation is, the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and compendious is our ſearch.</hi> The ſame places therefore, which will conduce to ſearch the mind of our inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and underſtanding; and to draw forth the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there ſtored up; will alſo helpe us to produce know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from without. So as if a man of Learning, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be in preſence, we might be able, aptly and wiſely to propound a Queſtion thereof; and likewiſe profitably ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and peruſe Auctors and Books, or parts of Books, which might teach and informe us of thoſe points we enquire.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>But Particular Topiques doe much more conduce to the Purpoſe we ſpeake of;</hi>
                  <note n="✿" place="margin">TOPICAE PARTICV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARES.</note> 
                  <hi>and is to be accompted a thing of farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe.</hi> There hath bin indeed ſome ſlight mention made hereof, by ſome Writers; but it hath not yet bin handled ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and according to the dignity of the Subject. But to let paſſe that humour and pride, which hath raigned too long in Schools, which is, <hi>to purſue with infinite ſubtiltie, things that are within their command; but never to touch at things any whit removed;</hi> we doe receive and embrace <hi>Particular Topique</hi> as a matter of great uſe, that is, <hi>Places of Enquiry, and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:150781:180"/> Jnvention, appropriate to Particular Subjects and Sciences;</hi> and theſe <hi>Places are certaine mixtures of Logique, and the proper matter of Particular Sciences.</hi> For he is but a weake man, and of narrow capacity, who conceives that the Art of <hi>finding out Sciences</hi> may be found out, propounded, and perfected, at once, even in their firſt conception; and preſently be ſet downe, and practiſed in ſome worke. But let men know for certaine, <hi>That ſolid and true Arts of Invention doe ſhoote up, &amp; come to maturity with the Inventions themſelves: So as when a man first enters upon the ſearch of a knowledge, he may have many profitable Precepts of Invention; but after he hath made farther progreſſe in the knowledge it ſelfe, he may, and muſt excogitate new Precepts of Jnvention, which may, lead him more proſperou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly to further Diſcoveries.</hi> For this kind of Purſuite is like a going upon a Plaine and open Champion; for after we have gone a part of the way; we have not only gained this, that we are now neerer to our journeyes end; but we gaine the better ſight of that part of the way, which remaines. So e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very degree of <hi>Proceeding in Sciences,</hi> having paſt over that which is left behind, gives a better proſpect to that which followes. And becauſe we ſet downe this Part of Topique as DEFICIENT, we will annex an example thereof.</p>

               <p>I <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>ET us now paſſe to <hi>Iudgment, or the Art of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which handleth the Nature of Proofes, or Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</hi> And in this <hi>Art of Iudging</hi> (as alſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it is accepted) <hi>a Concluſion is inferred, either by Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or elſe by Syllogiſme:</hi> For <hi>Enthymemes,</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> are only the abridgements of theſe two. <hi>As for Iudgment</hi> that it is by <hi>Induction</hi> we need nothing doubt. <hi>For by one and the ſame Operation of the Mind, that which is ſought, is both found and Iudged.</hi> Neither is the thing perfected by any meane, but immediately after the ſame manner, for moſt part, as it is in <hi>Senſe:</hi> For <hi>Senſe,</hi> in hir Primarie objects, doth at once ſeize upon the ſpecies of an object, and conſent to the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. <hi>But it is otherwiſe in Syllogiſme,</hi> the Proofe whereof is not <hi>Jmmediate,</hi> but perfected by a <hi>Mean;</hi> and therefore <hi>the Jnven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Medium is one thing; and the Iudgment of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of Argument, is another. For the mind firſt diſcourſeth, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards reſts ſatisfied.</hi> But a <hi>vitious forme of Induction</hi> we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly diſclaime; a <hi>Legitimate Forme</hi> we referre over to the <hi>New Organ.</hi> Therefore enough in this place, of <hi>Judgment by Induction.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:150781:183"/>
               <p>§ For that other <hi>Iudgment by Syllogiſme,</hi> to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is it to ſpeake, ſeeing this is by the ſubtle files off mens wits almoſt worne away, and reduced into many minute peeces? And no marvell being it is a thing hath ſuch Sympathie with mans underſtanding. <hi>For the mind of man doth wonderfully endeavour, and extremely covet this, that it may not be penſile; but that it may light upon ſomething fixt, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable, on which as on a firmament it may ſupport it ſelfe, in its ſwift motions and diſquiſitions.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">De Animal. Motione.</note> Surely, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> endevoureth to prove, <hi>That in all motion of Bodies there is ſome point quieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; and very elegantly expoundeth the Ancient Fable of</hi> Atlas, <hi>that ſtood fixed, and bare up the heavens from falling; to be meant of the Poles of the World, whereupon the Converſion is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſht. In like manner men doe earneſtly ſeeke to have ſome Atlas, or Axeltree of their Cogitations within themſelves, which may in ſome meaſure moderate the fluctuations, and wheelings of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,</hi> fearing it may be, the falling of their heaven. Therefore <hi>men have haſtned too faſt to ſet downe Principles of Sciences, about which all the varietie of Diſputations might turne without perill of ruine or Subverſion. Jn truth not knowing that he who too early layes hold on certainties, will conclude in ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and he that ſeaſonably ſuſpends his Iudgment, ſhall attaine to Certainties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ So then it is manifeſt, that this <hi>Art of Judging by Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme</hi> is nothing elſe, but the reduction of Propoſitions to Principles, by middle termes; and Principles are underſtood to be agreed of by all, and are exempt from Argument. But the invention of middle termes is permitted to the free ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity, &amp; purſuit of mens wits. This <hi>Reduction is of two kinds, Direct, and Jnverted. Direct</hi> is, when the Propoſition is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Principle, which is call'd <hi>Probation Oſtenſive. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed</hi> is, when the Contradictorie of the Propoſition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Contradictorie of the Principle; which they terme a <hi>Probation from incongruitie, or an abſurdity.</hi> The number alſo of middle terms, or their ſcale is diminiſhed or increaſed, as they are remov'd from the Principle of the Propoſition.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:150781:183"/>
               <p>§ <hi>Theſe grounds laid, we will divide the Art of Iudgment</hi> (as for moſt part generally it is) <hi>into Analytique Art; and the Doctrine of Elenchs;</hi> the one giveth Direction; the other Caution. <hi>For Analytique</hi> ſetteth downe the true formes of Conſequences of Arguments; by a variation, and deflection, from which, the Concluſion is deprehended to be errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and this part containes in it a kind of <hi>Elench,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">V. Euclid. &amp; Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment.</note> or Redar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gution. For, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rectum &amp; ſui index eſt, &amp; obliqui.</hi> Notwithſtanding it is the ſafeſt way to ſet downe <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenchs</hi> as Monitors, whereby <hi>Fallacies,</hi> which otherwiſe might inſnare the Iudgment, may be more eaſily detected. <hi>In the Analytique</hi> Part we find nothing DEFICIENT, which rather is loaden'd with ſuperfluities, than any way is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in acceſſions.</p>
               <p>II <hi>The Knowledge of Elenchs</hi> we divide into three Parts: <hi>Elenchs of Sophiſmes; Elenchs of Jnterpretation;</hi> and <hi>Elenchs of J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages or Idôlaes.</hi> The Doctrine of <hi>Elenchs of Sophiſmes</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſefull; for although the more groſſe ſort of <hi>Fallacies</hi> is (as <hi>Seneca</hi> makes the compariſon very well;<note place="margin">Epiſt. 45.</note>) <hi>But as the feates of Iuglers which though we know not how they are done; yet we know well it is not as it ſeemes to be.</hi> Yet the more ſubtile ſort of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes</hi> doth not only put a man beſides his anſwer, but doth in good earneſt abuſe his Judgment.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>This Part concerning the Elenchs of Sophiſmes</hi> is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently handled by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in <hi>Precept;</hi> but more excellently by <hi>Plato</hi> in example,<note place="margin">In Dial. ità inſcript.</note> not only in the Perſon of the Ancient Sophiſts; <hi>Gorgias; Hippias; Protagoras,</hi> and <hi>Euthidemus,</hi> and the reſt; but even in the Perſon of Socrates himſelfe, who profeſſing to affirme nothing, but to infirme whatſoever o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers avouch, hath exactly expreſſed all the formes of <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Fallacies,</hi> and <hi>Redargutions.</hi> Wherefore in this part we have nothing DEFICIENT. But this, in the meane time, is to be noted, that though we make the ingenuous and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall uſe of this Knowledge to conſiſt in this, <hi>That Sophiſmes may be redargued; yet it is manifeſt, that the degenerate and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt uſe thereof, is imploy'd to contrive, and impoſe, captions and Contradictions, by theſe Sophiſmes; which paſſeth for a great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:150781:184"/> and no doubt is of great advantage.</hi> Though the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was elegantly made by one betwixt an Orator, and a Sophiſt, <hi>That the one is as the Grey-Hound, which hath his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the race; the other as the Hare which hath hir advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the turne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ Now follow <hi>Elenchi Hermeniae,</hi> for ſo we will call them, borrowing the Word, rather than the Senſe, from <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle.</hi> And here let us call to mens memorie what we have ſaid before; (when we handled <hi>Primitive Philoſophie</hi>) of <hi>tranſcendent, and adventitious Conditions, or Adjuncts of Entitie,</hi> they be <hi>Majoritie, Minoritie; Much, Litle; Prioritie, Poſteriori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; Identitie, Diverſitie; Power, Act; Habit, Privation; Totality, Partialitie; Activitie, Paſsivitie; Motion, Quietude; Entity, Non-Entity,</hi> and the like. But ſpecially let men remember, and obſerve the different Contemplations of theſe Properties, which is, that they may be inquired, either <hi>Phyſically,</hi> or <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically.</hi> The Phyſicall handling of theſe adherent Qualities we have aſſigned to <hi>Primitive Philoſophie.</hi> The <hi>Logicall</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, &amp; that is the very thing which we here ſtile <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam de Elenchis Hermeniae,</hi> the <hi>Knowledge of the Elenches of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi> This indeed is a ſound &amp; materiall Portion of Knowledge: <hi>For theſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune and generall Notions have this Nature, that in all diſputations they every where intervene, ſo as if they be not by a carefull Iudgment accurately diſtinguiſht at firſt; they may wonderfully overcloud the whole light of Diſputations; and even bring the caſe to that paſſe, that the Diſputations ſhall be reſolved into a skirmiſh of words. For Aequivocations, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious acception of words</hi> (ſpecially of this Nature) <hi>are the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſmes of Sophiſmes.</hi> Wherefore it ſeemeth better to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Treatiſe of them apart, than to receive them into <hi>Prime Philoſophy,</hi> I meane <hi>Metaphyſique;</hi> or to annexe them as a part of <hi>Analytiques,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ariſt. Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyt.</note> 
                  <hi>which Aristotle very confuſedly hath done.</hi> And we have given it a name from the nature and Uſe; <hi>for the right uſe is plainly Redargution, and Caution about the acception of words.</hi> Nay that Part of <hi>Predicaments</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Cautions, of not confounding, and tranſpoſing the termes of <hi>Definitions</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> if it were rightly inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:150781:184"/> would be of ſingular uſe, in our judgment, and might fitly be referred hether. And thus much of the <hi>Elenchs of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III <hi>As for the Elenchs of Jmages or Idolaes;</hi>
                  <note n="✿" place="margin">ELENCHI IDOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RVM.</note> 
                  <hi>certainly Jdolaes are the profoundeſt Fallacies of the mind of man.</hi> Nor doe they deceive in <hi>Particulars,</hi> as the reſt doe; caſting a Cloud, and ſpreading ſnares over the Iudgment; but apertly from a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and crookedly-ſet prediſpoſition of the mind; which doth, as it were, wreſt and infect all the anticipations of the underſtanding. <hi>For the mind of man</hi> (drawn over, and clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the ſable Pavillion of the Body) is ſo farre from being like a ſmooth, equall, and cleere Glaſſe, which might ſincerely take and reflect the beames of things, according to their true incidence; that it is rather like an inchanted Glaſſe, full of Superſtitions; Apparitions, and Impoſtures.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Idolaes are impoſed upon the understanding, either by the univerſall Nature of man in generall. Or from the individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Nature of Particulars;</hi> or <hi>by words, or nature Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</hi> The firſt ſort of Images we wont to call, <hi>Idola Tribûs;</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Jdola Specûs;</hi> the third, <hi>Idola Fori.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">NOV. OR. LIB. 1. APH.

And this <hi>ſubſidiary ſecond,</hi> is alſo of moſt ſpeciall uſe in <hi>Inductive Philoſophy, and the Interpretation of Nature.</hi> For a man may as well perfect, and ſumme up the <hi>Computations</hi> of an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemerides</hi> by meere <hi>Memory;</hi> as comprehend the <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> by meditations, and the nude, and native ſtrength of <hi>Memory;</hi> unleſſe the ſame <hi>Memory</hi> be aſſiſted by <hi>Tables,</hi> and <hi>Indices</hi> provided for that Purpoſe. But to let goe the <hi>Interpretation of Nature,</hi> which is a new Knowledge; there ſcarcely can be a thing more uſefull even to ancient,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:150781:187"/> and popular Sciences, than a ſolid, and good <hi>Aide</hi> to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;</hi> that is, a ſubſtantiall and Learned <hi>Digeſt</hi> of <hi>Common places.</hi> Neither am I ignorant, <hi>that the referring of thoſe things we read, or learne, into Common-Places, is imputed by ſome as a Prejudice to Learning; as cauſing a retardation of Reading, and a ſlothfull relaxation to Memory.</hi> But becauſe it is a Counterfeit thing in Knowledge, to be forward and pregnant, unleſſe you be withall deepe and full; I hold that the diligence, and paines in collecting <hi>Common-Places,</hi> is of great uſe and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in ſtudying; as that which Subminiſters Copie to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;</hi> and contracteth the ſight of Iudgment to a ſtrength. <hi>But this is true, that of the Methods and Syntagmes of Common-Places, which we have ſeene, there is none that is of any worth; for that in their Titles, they meerly repreſent the face, rather of a Schoole, than of the world; exhibiting Vulgar and Pedanticall Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and not ſuch as any way penetrate the Marrow and Pith of things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ As for <hi>Memory</hi> it ſelfe; that in my Iudgment hetherto hath bin looſely, and weakly inquired into. There is indeed an Art extant of it; but we are certaine that there may be had both better Precepts for the confirming and increaſing <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> than that Art comprehendeth; and a better Practice of that Art may be ſet downe, than that which is receiv'd. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe we doubt (if any man have a mind to abuſe this Art to oſtentation) but that many wonderfull and prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters may be performed by it. But for uſe (as it is now managed) it is a barren thing. Yet this in the meane time we doe not taxe it withall, that it doth ſupplant, or ſurcharge <hi>Naturall Memory</hi> (as commonly is objected) but that it is not dexterouſly applied to lend aſſiſtance to <hi>Memory</hi> in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and ſerious occaſions. And we have learned this (it may be from our practiſed Courſe in a civile calling) that whatſoever makes oſtentation of Art, and gives no aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of uſe, we eſtime as nothing worth. For to repeate on the ſodaine a great number of names or words, upon once hearing, in the ſame order they were delivered; or to powre forth a number of a verſes upon any argument <hi>ex tempore;</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:150781:187"/> or to taxe every thing that falls out in ſome ſatyricall ſimile; or the turning of every thing to a jeſt; or the eluding of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing by a contradiction or cavill; and the like; whereof in the faculties of the mind there is a great ſtore; and ſuch as by wit and practice may be exalted to a great degree of wonder. All theſe and the like, we make no more eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, than we doe of the agilities, and tricks of Tumblers; Buffones, &amp; Iuglers. For they are almoſt all one thing, ſeeing theſe abuſe the Powers of the Body, theſe the Powers of the mind; and perchance they may have ſome ſtrangeneſſe in them; but litle or no worthineſſe.</p>
               <p>II <hi>This Art of Memory</hi> is built upon two Intentions, <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion</hi> and <hi>Emblem.</hi> we call <hi>Prenotion a Preciſion of endleſſe inveſtigation;</hi> for when a man would recall any thing to <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> if he have no <hi>Prenotion</hi> or <hi>Preception</hi> of that he ſeeketh, he ſearcheth indeed, and taketh paines, rounding this way and that way, as in a maze of infinitie. But if he have any certaine <hi>Prenotion,</hi> preſently that which is infinite is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged &amp; cut off; and the queſting of the <hi>Memory</hi> is brought within a more narrow compaſſe; as in the hunting of a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Deere within the Parke. Therefore it is evident, <hi>that Method helpes the Memory;</hi> for <hi>Prenotion</hi> ſuggeſteth that it muſt agree with order. So verſes are ſooner gotten by heart than Proſe; for if a man make a doubtfull ſtand at a word, <hi>Prenotion</hi> prompts him that the word which agrees with the verſe, muſt be of ſuch a Nature. And this <hi>Prenotion</hi> is the firſt part of Artificiall <hi>Memory.</hi> For in <hi>Memory Artificiall</hi> we have places digeſted &amp; provided before hand: But we make <hi>Jmages extempore,</hi> according as the preſent ſhall require. But <hi>Prenotion</hi> doth admoniſh that the <hi>Image</hi> muſt be ſuch as hath ſome reſemblance with the <hi>Place;</hi> this is that which awaketh, and in ſome ſort muniteth the <hi>Memory</hi> in the chaſe of what we ſeeke.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Embleme deduceth Conceptions Jntellectuall</hi> to <hi>Images ſenſible, and that which is ſenſible, more forcibly ſtrikes the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and is more eaſily imprinted, than that which is Jntellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> So we ſee that even the <hi>Memory</hi> of Beaſts is ſtirr'd up by

               </p>
               <p>II Let us proceed to <hi>Grammer; this doth beare the office as it were, of an Vſher to other Sciences; a place not very honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet very neceſſary, eſpecially ſeeing that in our age Sciences are chiefly drawne from Learned Languages, and not from Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-tongues.</hi> Nor is the dignity thereof to be eſtimed meane, ſeeing it ſupplies the place of an Antidote, againſt that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction</hi> of the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of <hi>Tongues.</hi> Surely the Induſtry of man ſtriveth to reſtore, and redintegrate himſelfe in thoſe Benedictions, which by his guilt he forfeited; and by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts, armes and ſtrengthens himſelfe againſt that firſt generall Curſe of the <hi>sterility of the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and the eating of his bread in the ſweat of his browes.</hi> But againſt that ſecond Curſe, which was the <hi>Confuſion</hi> of <hi>Tongues, he calls in the aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Grammer.</hi> The uſe hereof in ſome Mother-tongues is indeed very ſmall; in forraine tongues more large; but moſt ample in ſuch tongues, as have ceaſed to be vulgar, and are perpetuated only in Books.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>We will divide Grammer into two ſorts, whereof the one is Literary; the other Philoſophicall.</hi> The one is meerly applied to Languages, that they may be more ſpeedily learned; or more correctedly and purely ſpoken. <hi>The other</hi> in a ſort doth miniſter,<note place="margin">Suet. in Iul.</note> and is ſubſervient to <hi>Philoſophie.</hi> In this later part which is <hi>Philoſophicall,</hi>
                  <note n="✿" place="margin">GRAMMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICA PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHANS.</note> we find <hi>that Caeſar writ Books</hi> DE A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALOGIA; and it is a queſtion whether thoſe Books han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled this Philoſophicall Grammer whereof we ſpeake? Our opinion is that there was not any high and ſubtile mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:150781:191"/> in them, but only that they deliver'd Precepts of a pure and perfect ſpeech, not depraved by popular Cuſtome; nor corrupted and polluted by over-curious affectation; in which kind <hi>Caeſar</hi> excell'd. <hi>Notwithſtanding,</hi> admoniſh't by ſuch a worke, we have conceiv'd and comprehended in our mind, a kind of Grammer, that may diligently enquire, not the <hi>Analogie of words one</hi> with another, but the <hi>Analogie</hi> between Words and Things, or Reaſon; beſides that <hi>Jn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of Nature,</hi> which is ſubordinate to <hi>Logique.</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Words</hi> are the <hi>foot-ſteps of Reaſon;</hi> and foot-ſteps doe give ſome indications of the Body; wherefore we will give ſome generall deſcription of this.<note place="margin">In Cratyl.</note> And firſt we doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that curious inquiry which <hi>Plato</hi> an excellent man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, touching the <hi>impoſition</hi> and <hi>originall Etymology of names.</hi> conceiving it, <hi>as if words had not bin impoſed at firſt, ad Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum; but were ſignificantly derived and deduced from a certaine reaſon and intendment.</hi> Certainly an elegant and pliant ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which might be aptly fain'd and made ſquare to the purpoſe; and by reaſon it ſeemeth to ſearch the ſecrets of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, in ſome kind reverend. But yet ſparingly mixt with truth, and without fruit. <hi>But without</hi> queſtion that would be a moſt excellent kind of <hi>Grammer</hi> (as we ſuppoſe) if ſome man throughly inſtructed in many <hi>Languages,</hi> as well <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> as <hi>Mother-tongues,</hi> ſhould write a Treatiſe of the diverſe Proprieties of <hi>Languages;</hi> ſhewing in what points every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Language did excell; and in what points it was DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICIENT. For ſo <hi>Tongues</hi> might be enricht and perfected by mutuall intertrafique one with another; and a moſt faire Image of ſpeech (like the Venus of Apelles); and a goodly patterne for the true expreſſion of the inward ſenſe of the mind, might be drawne from every part which is excellent in every Language. <hi>And withall</hi> no ſlight Conjectures, but ſuch as were well worth the obſervation, might be taken (which a man perchance would litle think) touching the naturall diſpoſitions and cuſtomes of People, and Nations, even from their Languages. <hi>For I willingly</hi> give eare to <hi>Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> noting that the Grecians have not a word which may
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:150781:192"/> expreſſe this Latine word,<note place="margin">De Orat. l. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Jneptum; becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this vice was ſo familiar to the Grecians, that they did not ſo much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves guilty thereof.</hi> Certainly a Cenſure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a Roman gravity. And what may that inferre, that the Grecians uſed ſuch a Liberty in compoſition of words, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywiſe the Romans were in this point ſevere? Surely a man may plainly collect that the Grecians were more fit to ſtudy Arts; the Romans to manage affaires of ſtate. For di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions of Arts, for moſt part, require compoſition of words; but matters and buſineſſe, ſimple words. <hi>But the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes ſo ſhunne Compoſition, that they make choice rather to ſtraine a Metaphor too farre, than to bring in a Compoſition.</hi> Nay they uſe ſo few words, and ſo unmingled, that a man may plainly perceive by their Tongue, that they were a Nazarite People, and ſeparate from other Nations. <hi>And is not that</hi> worthy obſervation (though it may ſerve to abate our high conceipt of our owne times) <hi>that Ancient Languages were more full of Declenſions; Caſes; Conjugations; Tenſes, and the like; the moderne commonly deſtitute of theſe, doe looſely deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in many expreſsions by Prepoſitions, and auxiliary verbes.</hi> Certainly a man may eaſily conjecture (however we may pleaſe our ſelves) that the wits of former times were farre more acute and ſubtile than ours are. There are an infinite number of obſervations of this kind which might make up a juſt Volume. Wherefore it will not be amiſſe to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>Grammer Philoſophicall,</hi> from <hi>meere and literary Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> and to ſet it downe as DEFICIENT. Vnto <hi>Grammer</hi> alſo belongs the conſideration of all <hi>Accidents</hi> of words; ſuch as are <hi>Meaſure; Sound; Accent;</hi> but thoſe firſt infancies of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Letters (as, with what Percuſſion of the Tongue, with what opening of the mouth; with what drawing of the lips, with what ſtraining of the throat; the ſound of every Particular <hi>Letter</hi> is to be made) belongs not unto <hi>Grammer;</hi> but is a Portion of the <hi>knowledge of ſounds,</hi> to be handled <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ſenſibility. Grammaticall ſound,</hi> whereof we ſpeake, belongs only to ſweetneſſe &amp; harſhneſſe of ſounds; of which ſome are common; for there is no Tongue but in
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:150781:192"/> ſome ſort ſhunnes the too much overture of concurrent Vowels, and the aſperities of concurrent Conſonants. There are other reſpective ſounds which are pleaſing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the eare, according to the temper of diverſe Nations. <hi>The Greeke Tongue</hi> is full of Diphthonges; the Latine is farre more ſparing; the Spaniſh Tongue hates ſmall-ſounding Letters, and preſently changeth them into Letters of a middle tone; the Tongues deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Gothes delight in Aſpirates; there are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable of this nature, but perchance theſe are more than enough.</p>
               <p>III <hi>But the meaſure of words</hi> hath brought us forth an immenſe body of Art, namely <hi>Poeſie;</hi> not in reſpect of the matter (of which we have ſpoken before) but in reſpect of ſtile and the forme of words, as <hi>Metre</hi> or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe;</hi> touching which the Art is very ſmall and briefe, but the acceſſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples large and infinite. Neither ought that Art (which the Grammarians call <hi>Proſodia</hi>) to be only reſtrain'd to the kinds and meaſures of <hi>Verſe;</hi> for there are Precepts to be annext, what kind of <hi>Verſe</hi> beſt fitteth every matter or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The Ancients applied <hi>Heroicall <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>erſe</hi> to <hi>Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Laudatories; Elegies</hi> to <hi>Lamentations; Jambiques</hi> to <hi>Invectives; Lyriques</hi> to <hi>Songs</hi> and <hi>Hymnes.</hi> And this wiſdome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients is not wanting in the <hi>Poets</hi> of later Ages in Mother-tongues; only this is to be reprehended, that ſome of them too ſtudious of Antiquity have endevoured to draw mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne Languages to Ancient Meaſures (as <hi>Heroique; Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaque; Saphique,</hi> and the reſt) which the fabrique and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe Languages, will not beare; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is no leſſe harſh unto the eare. In matters of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the judgment of ſenſe is to be preferr'd before pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepts of Art, as he ſaith,
<q>
                     <l>—Coenae Fercula noſtrae</l>
                     <l>Mallem Convivis quam placuiſſe Cocis.<note place="margin">Mart. Ep. 9.</note>
                     </l>
                  </q> Nor is <hi>this Art,</hi> but the abuſe of Art, ſeeing it doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, but perverts Nature. <hi>As for Poeſie (whether we ſpeake of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:150781:193"/> Fables, or Metre) it is, as we have ſaid before, as a Luxuriant Herb brought forth without ſeed, and ſprings up from the ſtrength and rankneſſe of the ſoyle. Wherefore it runs along every where, and is ſo amply ſpread, as it were a ſuperfluous labour to be curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of any</hi> DEFICIENTS <hi>therein;</hi> the care therefore for this is taken already.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for Accents of Words,</hi> there is no need, that wee ſpeake of ſo ſmall a matter; unleſſe, perchance, ſome may think it worth the noting, that there hath bin exact ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation made of the <hi>Accents of Words,</hi> but not of the <hi>Accents of Sentences;</hi> yet this, for moſt part, is the generall Cuſtome of all men, that in the cloſe of a Period they let fall their voice, in a demand they raiſe it, and many ſuch like uſages.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for writing,</hi> that is perform'd either by the vulgar Alphabet, which is every where receiv'd; or by a ſecret and private Alphabet, which men agree upon between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which they call <hi>Cyphers.</hi> But the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ulgar Orthography</hi> hath brought forth unto us a Controverſie, and Queſtion, namely, <hi>Whether words ſhould be written as they are ſpoken, or rather after the uſuall manner.</hi> But this kind of writing, which ſeemes to be reformed, which is, <hi>that writing ſhould be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to ſpeaking,</hi> is a branch of unprofitable ſubtelties; for <hi>Pronunciation</hi> it ſelfe every day encreaſes and alters the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; and the derivation of words, eſpecially from forrain Languages, are utterly defac'd and extinguiſht. In briefe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>writing,</hi> according to the receiv'd Cuſtome, doth no way prejudice the <hi>manner of ſpeaking,</hi> to what end ſhould this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation be brought in?</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Wherefore let us come to</hi> CYPHARS. Their kinds are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as <hi>Cyphars ſimple; Cyphars intermixt with Nulloes,</hi> or non-ſignificant Characters; <hi>Cyphers of double Letters under one Character; Wheele-Cyphars; Kay-Cyphars; Cyphars of words; Others.</hi> But the virtues of them whereby they are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd are Three; <hi>That they be ready, and not laborious to write; That they be ſure, and lie not open to Deciphering; And laſtly, if it
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:150781:193"/> be poſsible, that they may be managed without ſuſpition.</hi> For if Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Miſsive fall into their hands, that have ſome command and authority over thoſe that write; or over thoſe to whom they were written; though the Cypher it ſelfe bee ſure and impoſsible to be <hi>decypher'd,</hi> yet the matter is liable to examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and queſtion; unleſſe the <hi>Cypher</hi> be ſuch, as may be voide of all ſuſpicion, or may elude all examination. <hi>As for the ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> off examination, there is ready prepared a new and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble invention to this purpoſe; which, ſeeing it is eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, to what end ſhould we report it, as <hi>Deficient.</hi> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is this: That you have two ſorts of <hi>Alphabets,</hi> one of <hi>true Letters,</hi> the other of <hi>Non-ſignificants;</hi> and that you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe fould up two <hi>Letters;</hi> one which may carrie the ſecret, another ſuch as is probable the Writer might ſend, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out perill. Now if the Meſſenger be ſtrictly examined con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Cypher,</hi> let him preſent the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of <hi>Non-ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants</hi> for true <hi>Letters,</hi> but the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of true <hi>Letters</hi> for <hi>Non-ſignificants:</hi> by this Art the examiner falling upon the <hi>exterior Letter,</hi> and finding it probable, ſhall ſuſpect nothing of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Letter.</hi> But that jealouſies may be taken away, we will annexe an other invention, which, in truth, we deviſed in our youth, when we were at <hi>Paris:</hi> and is a thing that yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to us not worthy to be loſt. It containeth the <hi>higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Cypher,</hi> which is to ſignifie <hi>omnia per omnia,</hi> yet ſo as the <hi>writing infolding,</hi> may beare a quintuple proportion to the <hi>writing infolded;</hi> no other condition or reſtriction whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is required. It ſhall be performed thus: Firſt let all the <hi>Letters</hi> of the <hi>Alphabet,</hi> by tranſpoſition, be reſolved into two <hi>Letters</hi> onely; for the tranſpoſition of two <hi>Letters</hi> by five place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will be ſufficient for 32. Differences, much more for 24. which is the number of the <hi>Alphabet.</hi> The example of ſuch an <hi>Alphabet</hi> is on this wiſe.</p>

                  <hi>The knowledge of Cyphering,</hi> hath drawne on with it a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge relative unto it, which is the knowledge of <hi>Diſcyphering,</hi> or of Diſcreting <hi>Cyphers,</hi> though a man were utterly ignorant of the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of the <hi>Cypher,</hi> and the Capitulations of ſecrecy paſt between the Parties. <hi>Certainly</hi> it is an Art which requires great paines and a good witt and is (as the other was) conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate to the Counſels of Princes: yet notwithſtanding by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent previſion it may be made unprofitable, though, as things are, it be of great uſe. For if good and faithfull <hi>Cyphers</hi> were invented &amp; practiſed, many of them would delude and foreſtall all the Cunning of the <hi>Decypherer,</hi> which yet are very apt and eaſie to be read or written: but the rawneſſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skitfulneſſe of Secretaries, and Clarks in the Courts of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is ſuch, that many times the greateſt matters are Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to futile and weake Cyphers. But it may be, that in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeration, and, as it were, taxation of Arts, ſome may thinke that we goe about to make a great Muſter-rowle of Sciences, that the multiplication of them may be more admired; when their number perchance may be diſplayed, but their forces in ſo ſhort a Treatiſe can hardly be tried. <hi>But for</hi> our parts wee doe faithfully purſue our purpoſe, and in making this <hi>Globe of Sciences,</hi> we would not omitt the leſſer and remoter Ilands. <hi>Neither</hi> have we (in our opinion) touched theſe Arts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functorily, though curſorily; but with a piercing ſtile extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the marrow and pith of them out of a maſſe of matter. The judgement hereof we referre to thoſe who are moſt able to judge of theſe <hi>Arts. For ſeeing it is the faſhion of many who would be thought to know much, that every where making osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of words and outward termes of</hi> Arts, <hi>they become a wonder to the ignorant, but a deriſion to thoſe that are Maſters of thoſe</hi> Arts: <hi>we hope that our Labours ſhall have a contrarie ſucceſſe, which is, that they may arrest the judgment of every one who is beſt vers'd in every particular</hi> Art; <hi>and be undervalued by the reſt.</hi> As for thoſe <hi>Arts</hi> which may ſeeme to bee of inferior ranke and order, if any man thinke wee attribute too much unto them; Let him looke about him and hee ſhall ſee that there bee many of ſpeciall note and great account in
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:150781:196"/> their owne Countrie, who when they come to the chiefe City or ſeat of the Eſtate, are but of mean ranke and ſcarcely regarded: ſo it is no marvaile if theſe ſleighter <hi>Arts,</hi> placed by the Principall and ſupreme <hi>Sciences,</hi> ſeeme pettie things; yet to thoſe that have choſen to ſpend their labours and ſtudies in them, they ſeeme great and excellent matters.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et us now come to the doctrine concerning the Method of Speech:</hi> This hath bin handled as a part of <hi>Logick,</hi> ſo it hath found a place in <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> by the name of <hi>Diſpoſition.</hi> But the placeing of <hi>it</hi> as a part of the Traine of other <hi>Arts,</hi> hath bin the cauſe that many things which referre unto <hi>it,</hi> and are uſefull to be knowne, are pretermiſs'd: wherefore we thought good, to conſtitute a <hi>ſubſtantiall and principall Doctrine</hi> touching <hi>Method,</hi> which by a generall name we call the <hi>wiſedome of Tradition. The kinds of Method,</hi> ſeeing they are divers, we will rather reckon them up, then divide them. <hi>But for one onely</hi> Method, <hi>and continued</hi> Dichotomies <hi>we neede not ſpeake much of them; for it was a little Cloude of knowledge which was ſoon diſperſed. Certainly a triviall invention, and an infinite prejudice to Sciences; for theſe</hi> Dichotomiſts, <hi>when they would wreſt all things to the Lawes of their Method, and whatſoever doth not aptly fall within thoſe</hi> Dichotomies <hi>they would either omitt or bow contrarie to their naturall inclination;</hi> they bring it ſo to paſſe, that the <hi>Kernels and Graines of Sciences leape out, and they claſpe and

               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Wherefore let the firſt difference of <hi>Method</hi> be ſet downe, to be either <hi>Magiſtrall</hi> or <hi>Initiative:</hi> neither do wee ſo underſtand the word <hi>Initiative,</hi> as if <hi>this</hi> ſhould lay the ground-worke, the <hi>other</hi> raiſe the perfect building of <hi>Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;</hi> but in a farre different ſenſe, (borrowing the word from ſacred Ceremonies) wee call that <hi>Initiative Method,</hi> which diſcloſeth and unvailes the Myſteries of Knowledges: For <hi>Magiſtrall teacheth, Initiative inſinuateth: Magiſtrall requires our beliefe to what is delivered, but Initiative that it may rather be ſubmitted to examination.</hi>
                  <note n="✚" place="margin">TRADITIO LAMPADIS, SIVE ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODUS AD FILIOS.</note> The <hi>one</hi> delivers popular <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> fit for Learners; the <hi>other Sciences</hi> as to the <hi>Sonnes of Science:</hi> In ſumme, the one is referred to the uſe of <hi>Sciences</hi> as they now are; the other to their continuation, and further propagation. <hi>The latter of theſe,</hi> ſeemes to bee a deſerted and an incloſed path. For Knowledges are now delivered, as if both Teacher and Scholler ſought to lay claime to errour, as upon contract. <hi>For hee that teacheth, teacheth in ſuch a manner as may beſt bee beleeved, not as may bee beſt examined: and hee that learneth, deſires rather pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſatisfaction, then to expect a juſt and ſtayed enquirie; and rather not to doubt, then not to erre: So as both the Maſter, out of a deſire of glorie, is watchfull, that hee betray not the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his knowledge; and the Scholler, out of an averſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to labour, will not try his owne ſtrength.</hi> But Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which is delivered as a thread to bee ſpunne on, <hi>ought to bee intimated</hi> (if it were poſsible) <hi>into the minde of another, in the ſame method wherein it was at firſt invented.</hi> And ſurely this may bee done in knowledge acquired by <hi>Induction:</hi> But in this ſame anticipated and prevented knowledge, which wee uſe, a man cannot eaſily ſay by what courſe of ſtudy hee came to the knowledge hee hath obtained. But yet certainly more or leſſe a man may reviſite his owne <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and meaſure over againe the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:150781:197"/> footſteps of his <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and of his conſent; and by this meanes ſo tranſplant <hi>Science</hi> into the mind of another, as it grew in his owne. For it is in <hi>Arts,</hi> as it is in <hi>Plants;</hi> if you meane to uſe the <hi>Plant,</hi> it is no matter for the Roots; but if you would remove into another ſoyle, than it te more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to reſt upon roots than ſlips. So the <hi>Delivery</hi> of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as it is now uſed, <hi>doth preſent unto us faire Bodies indeed of Sciences, but without</hi> the <hi>Roots;</hi> good, doubtleſſe for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, <hi>but not for the Planter.</hi> But if you will have <hi>Sciences</hi> grow, you need not be ſo ſollicitous for the <hi>Bodies;</hi> apply all your care that the <hi>Roots</hi> may be taken up ſound, and entire, with ſome litle earth cleaving to them. Of which kind of <hi>Delivery, the Method</hi> of the <hi>Mathematiques</hi> in that ſubject, hath ſome ſhadow, but generally I ſee it neither put in ure, nor put in <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> and therefore number it amongſt DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FICIENTS; and we will call it <hi>Traditionem Lampadis, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery of the Lampe, or the Method bequeathed to the ſonnes of Sapience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Another diverſity of Method</hi> followeth, in the intention like the former, but for moſt part contrary in the iſſue. In this both theſe <hi>Methods</hi> agree, that <hi>they</hi> ſeparate the vulgar <hi>Auditors</hi> from the <hi>ſelect;</hi> here <hi>they</hi> differ, that the <hi>former</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduceth a more open way of <hi>Delivery</hi> than is uſuall; the <hi>other</hi> (of which we ſhall now ſpeake) a more reſerved &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. <hi>Let therefore</hi> the diſtinction of them be this, <hi>that the one is an Exotericall or revealed; the other an Acroamaticall, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed Method.</hi> For the ſame difference the Ancients ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved in publiſhing Books, the ſame we will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the manner it ſelfe of <hi>Delivery. So the Acroamatique Method</hi> was in uſe with the Writers of former Ages, and wiſely, and with judgment applied; but that <hi>Acroamatique</hi> and Aenigmatique kind of expreſſion is diſgraced in theſe later times, by many who have made it as a dubious and falſe light, for the vent of their counterfeit merchandice. But the pretence thereof ſeemeth to be this, that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate envelopings of <hi>Delivery,</hi> the Prophane Vulgar may be removed from the ſecrets of Sciences; and they only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:150781:198"/> which had either acquired the interpretation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables by Tradition from their Teachers; or by the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſubtlety of their own wit, could pierce the veile.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Another diverſity of Method</hi> followes, of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to <hi>Sciences,</hi> which is when Sciences are delivered by way of <hi>Aphoriſme;</hi> or <hi>Methods.</hi> For it is a thing worthy to be preciſely noted, that it hath bin often taken into Cuſtome, that men out of a few Axiomes and Obſervations upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subject, have made a compleat and ſolemne Art, filling it with ſome diſcourſes of wit, illuſtrating it with examples, and knitting it togither by ſome <hi>Method.</hi> But that other way of <hi>Delivery</hi> by <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> brings with it many advantages, whereto <hi>Delivery by Method</hi> doth not approach. For firſt it tries the Writer whether he be ſuperficial or ſolid in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> except they ſhould be altogither ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, cannot be made but out of the pyth and heart of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences: For Illuſtration and Excuſſion are cut off; variety of examples is cut off; Deduction and Connexion are cut off; Deſcription of Practice is cut off; ſo there remaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fill the Aphoriſmes, but a good quantity of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And therefore no man can ſuffice, nor in reaſon will attempt to write <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> who is not copiouſly furniſh't, and ſolidly grounded. But in <hi>Methods,</hi>
                  <q>
                     <l>
                        <note place="margin">Horat. de Art. P.</note>—Tantum ſeries, junctura<expan>

                  </q> As oftentimes they make a great ſhew of (I know not what) ſingular Art, which if they were disjoynted, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and laid open, would come to litle or nothing. Secondly <hi>Methodicall Delivery</hi> is more fit to win conſent or beliefe; but leſſe fit to point to Action; for <hi>they</hi> carry a ſhew of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration in or be</hi> or Circle, one part illuminating another; and therefore doe more ſatisfie the underſtanding; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Actions in common courſe of life are diſperſt, and not orderly digeſted, they doe beſt agree with diſperſed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections. Laſtly <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> repreſenting certaine Portions only, and as it were fragments of Sciences, invite others to contribute, and adde ſomething; whereas <hi>Methodicall Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:150781:198"/> carrying ſhew of a totall &amp; perfect Knowledge forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſecureth men as if they were at the furtheſt.</p>
               <p>§ An other diverſity of Method followes, which is likewiſe of great waight, which is when <hi>Sciences</hi> are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered either by <hi>Aſſertions</hi> with their <hi>Proofes</hi> annext; or by <hi>Queſtions</hi> togither with their <hi>Determinations.</hi> The later kind whereof if it be immoderately followed, is as prejudicious to the progreſſion of Sciences, as it is to the fortunes and proceedings of an Army, to goe about to beſiege every title Fort or Hold. For if the field be kept, and the ſumme of the enterprize with diligence purſued, thoſe ſmaller places will come in of themſelves. Yet this I cannot deny, that it is not alway ſafe to leave any great, and fortified towne at his back. <hi>In like manner the uſe of Confutations</hi> in the Delivery of Sciences ought to be very ſparing, and to ſerve only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and breake ſtrong Preoccupations and Prejudgments of mens minds, and not to excite and provoke <hi>ſmaller Doubts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Another diverſity of Method</hi> followeth which is that the <hi>Method be accommodated to the purpoſed matter which is to be handled.</hi> For there is a great difference in Delivery of the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> which are of knowledges the moſt abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and moſt ſimple; and the <hi>Politiques</hi> which are the moſt immerſed and compounded: Neither can an <hi>uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Method</hi> (as we have obſerv'd already) be fitly ſorted with <hi>multi-formity of Matter;</hi> and therefore as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Particular Topiques</hi> for <hi>Invention;</hi> ſo we would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in ſome meaſure have <hi>Particular Methods</hi> for <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Another diverſity of Method</hi> followeth, with judgment to be practis'd in the Delivery of Sciences; and it <hi>is directed according to the light of Informations, and anticipations, of the Knowledge to be delivered, infuſed, and impreſsed in the minds of the Learners.</hi> For that Knowledge which is new and forraine to mens minds, is to be delivered in an other forme than that which by long-receiv'd, and imbibed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions is naturalized and made familiar: And therefore <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> when he thinks to taxe <hi>Democritus</hi> doth in truth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:150781:199"/> him, where he ſaith, <hi>If we ſhall indeed diſpute, and not follow after ſimilitudes &amp;c.</hi> Charging it as a defect upon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> that he was too copious in <hi>Compariſons. But thoſe whoſe conceits are ſeated in popular opinions, have nothing elſe to doe but to diſpute and prove. Whereas on the contrary thoſe whoſe conceits are beyond popular opinions, have a double labour; first, that what they produce may be conceiv'd; then, that they be proved.</hi> So that it is of neceſſity with them to have recourſe to <hi>Similitudes</hi> and <hi>Tranſlations,</hi> whereby they may inſinuate themſelves into mens capacities. <hi>Therefore</hi> we ſee in the infancy of Learning, in rude times, when thoſe Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions which are now Vulgar and triviall, were then new and unheard of; the world was full of <hi>Parables</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes;</hi> for otherwiſe men would have paſſed over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mark or due attention, or elſe rejected for Paradoxes, that which was propounded. For it is a rule of Traditive Art, <hi>That whatſoever Science is not conſonant to Anticipations or Preſuppoſitions, muſt pray in ayd of Similitudes and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons.</hi> And thus much of the diverſe ſorts of Methods, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch as have not heretofore bin noted by others.

                  </gap>; than in obtruding <hi>one only Method</hi> and <hi>Dichotomie.</hi> But it falls out, I know not by what fate, <hi>that of humane things (according as the Poets often faigne) the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious have the most pernicious Keepers.</hi> Certainly diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours about the ranke and file of Propoſitions, caſt him
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:150781:199"/> upon thoſe <hi>Epitomes</hi> and <hi>ſhallowes of Sciences;</hi> for he had need ſet out in a lucky houre, and to goe on by the conduct of a happy Genius, that attempts to make <hi>Axiomes of Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Convertible;</hi> and yet withall not make them <hi>Circular,</hi> or returning into themſelves; notwitſtanding we deny not, but that <hi>Ramus</hi> intention in this kind was profitable. <hi>There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines yet two Limitations of Propoſitions;</hi> beſides that they may be made <hi>Convertible;</hi> the one touching the <hi>Extenſion;</hi> the other touching the <hi>Production</hi> of them. Surely Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges have, if a man marke it well two other dimenſions beſides <hi>Profunditie;</hi> namely <hi>Latitude</hi> and <hi>Longitude.</hi> For <hi>Profunditie</hi> is referr'd to the Truth and Reality of them; and theſe make them ſolid. As for the other two, <hi>Latitude</hi> may be taken and reckoned of Science into Science; <hi>Longitude</hi> may be accepted and underſtood from the higeſt generall Propoſition, to the loweſt particular in the ſame ſcience. The one comprehends the bounds and true limits of Sciences, that Propoſitions may be properly, not promiſcuouſly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled; and that all Repetition; Excurſion, &amp; Confuſion may be avoided: the other gives rule how farre, and to what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Particularitie, Propoſitions of ſciences may be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Certainly there is no doubt but ſomewhat muſt be left to uſe and Practice; for we ought to avoid the preciſe error of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> that we be not <hi>Cumini ſectores in Scientijs,</hi>

                  <hi>Mincers of Commin in ſciences;</hi> nor that we multiply diviſions to the loweſt Particularity. Wherefore how we ſhould mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate our ſelves in this point, is well worth the inquiry. For we ſee too remove Generalities unleſſe they be drawne downe, doe litle informe, nay rather expoſe Knowledge to the ſcorne of Practicall men; and are no more ayding to Practice, than an <hi>Ortelius Vniverſall Mappe</hi> is to direct the way between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York.</hi> Surely the better ſort of Rules have not unfitly bin compared to Glaſſes of ſteele, wherein you may ſee the Images of things, but firſt they muſt be filed and burniſht: ſo Rules and Precepts doe then help, after they have bin laboured and poliſht by Practice; but if thoſe Rules may be made cleere and Chryſtalline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:150781:200"/> it would be the more excellent, becauſe they would leſſe ſtand in need of diligence, labour, and exerciſe after. <hi>And thus much of the Knowledge of Method,</hi> which we have named the <hi>Wiſdome</hi> of <hi>Delivery.</hi> Nor can we here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit that many more vain-glorious, than learned have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured about a <hi>Method,</hi> which is not worthy the name of a lawfull <hi>Method,</hi> ſeeing it is rather a <hi>Method of Imposture;</hi> which yet to ſome vaporous, and vain-boaſting natures, without doubt hath bin moſt acceptible. This <hi>Method</hi> doth ſo ſprinkle drops of any Knowledge, that any halfe-learned Clark may with a litle ſuperficiary Knowledge make a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhew.<note place="margin">Lullius.</note> Such was the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Lullius;</hi> ſuch the <hi>Typocoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> drawne by many; which were nothing elſe but a heap and maſſe of words of all Arts, to give men countenance; that thoſe which have the termes of Art, might be thought to underſtand the Arts themſelves.

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:150781:210"/> Hower-glaſſe, then if it were meaſured with them: for if the weariſomeneſſe, and vexation of a diſeaſe, make the time ſeeme longer then in truth it is; yet the computation of time reformes that miſtake, and makes it ſhorter than that erroneous opinion conceived it to be. So in a dead Plaine (whereof even now we gave a contrary inſtance) it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times falls out, for though at firſt the eye preconceiv'd the way ſhorter, becauſe it was undivided, yet if upon this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, an opinion poſſeſſe the imagination of a farre ſhorter ſpace of ground then it proves to be, the fruſtrating of that vaine conceit, makes it ſeem longer than the truth.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here remaines two <hi>Appendices</hi> in generall, <hi>touching the Tradition of knowledge; the one Criticall; the other Pedanticall.</hi> For as the principall part of <hi>Tradition of Knowledge</hi> conſiſteth in writing of books; ſo the relative part thereof conſiſts in reading of Books: but reading is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned and directed, either by the help of Preceptors and Tutors; or perfited by every mans particular and proper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour and induſtry: and to this purpoſe conduce thoſe two knowledges whereof we have ſpoken. <hi>To the Criticall part appertaines; first, an emaculate correction and amended edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of approved Auctors;</hi> Whereby both the honour of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors themſelves is vindicated, and a light given to the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Readers. Wherein nevertheleſſe, the raſh diligence of ſome writers hath done great prejudice to ſtudies. For it
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:150781:224"/> is the manner of many Critiques, when they fall upon a paſſage which they doe not underſtand, preſently to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a fault in the copy. As in that place in <hi>Tacitus,</hi> when a certain Colony in the open Senate, claimed the priviledge of an <hi>Aſylum, Tacitus</hi> reports that the reaſons they preferr'd were not much favour'd by the Emperour and the Lords of the Senate; wherefore the Embaſſadors miſtruſting the iſſue of the buſineſſe, gave a round ſumme of mony to <hi>Titus Vinius,</hi> that he would mediate their cauſe, and take upon him the protection of their liberties; by this means their pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was heard and granted; <hi>Tum dignitas &amp; antiquitas Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniae valuit</hi> ſaith <hi>Tacitus,</hi> as if the arguments that ſeemed light before, were now made waighty, through bribes, and corruption. But one of the Critiques, a man of no obſcure note, hath expunged the word <hi>Tum,</hi> and in ſtead thereof, put in <hi>Tantum.</hi> And by this perverſe cuſtome of <hi>Critiques,</hi> it comes to paſſe (as one wiſely noteth) <hi>that the moſt corrected copies, are commonly the leaſt correct.</hi> Nay (to ſpeak truth) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the <hi>Critiques</hi> be well skill'd in the knowledges, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Books which they ſet forth, their diligence is with perill, and prejudice. <hi>Secondly there appertaines to the Critique Art, the Expoſition; and Explication of Auctors, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Scholies, Notes, Spicilegies, and the like.</hi> In labours of this kind, that worſt diſeaſe of <hi>Critiques</hi> hath ceas'd on many; that they blanch and wave many obſcurer paſſages; and ſuch as are plaine and perſpicuous, thoſe they dwell and expatiate upon, even to a faſtidious tediouſneſſe; and it is not ſo much intended, that the Auctor may be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that the <hi>Critique</hi> may take occaſion hereby to glorify himſelfe, in his multiplicious and various learning. It could be eſpecially wiſhed (although this point belongs to <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in chiefe, and not to <hi>Appendices</hi>) that the writer which handles obſcure and noble Arguments, ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexe his own <hi>explications;</hi> that neither the text it ſelfe may be broken off, by <hi>Digreſsions</hi> and <hi>Explications;</hi> and that the Annotations may not depart from the mind and intention of the writer. Some ſuch thing we conceive of <hi>Theon</hi> upon
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:150781:224"/> 
                  <hi>Euclid. Thirdly it belongs to Critique Art</hi> (from whence it derives the name) <hi>to interpoſe a briefe cenſure and judgement of the Auctors which they publiſh, and to compare and valew them with other Auctors upon the ſame ſubject:</hi> That by ſuch a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Learned and ſtudious, may be both advertis'd of the choice of Books; and come better provided to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeing of them. This laſt duty is, as it were, <hi>the Chaire of the Critiques,</hi> which many great and famous men in our age have ennobled; greater ſurely in our judgement, than for the model of <hi>Critiques.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>For Pedanticall knowledge,</hi> it were ſoon ſaid, <hi>conſult the Schooles of the Ieſuites, for there is nothing for the uſe and practice better then their Precepts:</hi> but we will according to our manner, as it were, gleaning a few eares, give ſome few advertiſements. <hi>We doe by all means approve a Collegiat edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Inſtitution of Childhood and Youth;</hi> not in private houſes, nor only under Schoolemaſters. There is in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges a greater emulation of Youth towards their equalls; beſides, there is the ſight and countenance of Grave men, which ſeems to command modeſty; and faſhions and moulds tender minds, even from their firſt growth to the ſame Patterne: in ſome there are many other utilities of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat Education.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>For the order</hi> and manner of Diſcipline, this I would principally adviſe; <hi>that Youth beware of compends and abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and too forward maturation of knowledge, which maks men bold and confident; and rather wants great proceeding, than cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>Further there is an indulgence to be given to the liberty and vent of nature in particulars;</hi> as if there be any which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes ſuch taskes as the diſcipline of the place requires; and yet withall ſteales ſome howers to beſtow on other ſtudies, to which he hath a naturall propenſity; ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition by no means ſhould be checkt or reſtrain'd.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Againe,</hi> it will be worth the paines diligently to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve (which perchance hetherto hath not bin noted) that there are two waies, and they as it were, reflexively oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:150781:225"/> of <hi>training</hi> up of wits, and of <hi>exerciſing</hi> and <hi>preparing</hi> them. The one <hi>begins with</hi> the <hi>more eaſy precepts, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees leads us to the more difficult; the other at firſt commands and preſſeth more difficult practiſes, which when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, the other ſweetly yeeld and are won with eaſe.</hi> For it is one <hi>Method</hi> to practiſe ſwimming by bladders which lift up, and an other <hi>Method</hi> to practiſe dauncing with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy ſhooes, which preſſe down the Body; and it is not eaſy to expreſſe, how much a wiſe intermixtion of theſe <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> conduceth to the advanceing of the faculties, both of Mind and of the Body.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>So the Application and Election of ſtudies according to the propriety of wits, which are inſtructed, is a matter of ſingular uſe and judgement; a true and perfit diſcovery whereof, Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Tutors owe to the Parents of Children, from whom they may expect ſuch informations, that ſo they may the better adviſe upon the particular courſe of life, unto which they would deſigne, and dedicate their ſonnes.</hi> But this alſo is to be exactly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that not only exceeding great progreſsion may be made in thoſe ſtudies, to which a man is ſwayed by a naturall proclivity; but alſo that there may be found, in <hi>studies</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſelected for that purpoſe, cures and remedies to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote ſuch kind of knowledge, to the impreſsions whereof, a man may, by ſome imperfection of nature, be moſt unapt and inſufficient. <hi>As for example,</hi> if a man be <hi>Bird-witted,</hi> that is, quickly carried away, and hath not the patient facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of attention; the <hi>Mathematiques</hi> gives a remedy thereunto, wherein, if the wit be caught away but for a moment, the demonſtration is new to beginne.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>So of exerciſes in courſe of teaching, there is matter of great conſequence: but there is a point here that hath bin noted of few, that there ſhould be of exerciſes, not only a wiſe institution, but alſo a wiſe intermiſsion.</hi> It hath bin excellently obſerved by <hi>Cicero, That in exerciſes it often falls out, that men practiſe as well their faults, as their faculties;</hi> ſo that an <hi>ill habit</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times gotten, and inſinuates it ſelfe togither with a <hi>Good;</hi> wherefore it is a ſafer way to break off exerciſes, and after
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:150781:225"/> to fall to them againe, than inceſſantly to purſue and preſſe them. <hi>But of theſe enough.</hi> Certainly theſe things at firſt view ſeem no ſuch ſolemne and grave matters, yet are they in the iſſue found efficacious and uſefull. <hi>For as in Plants,</hi> the wronging or cheriſhing of them while they are Young is that, that is moſt important to their thriving or miſcarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or as the immenſe greatneſſe of the ſtate of Rome, is by ſome deſervedly attributed to the virtue and wiſdome of thoſe <hi>ſixe Kings,</hi> which were as Tutors and Foſter-fathers of that ſtate in the Infancy thereof: ſo ſurely the culture and manurance of minds in young and tender years, hath ſuch a forcible operation (though unſeen and not obvious to every mans obſervation) which neither length of time, or aſsidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and contention of Labour in riper age afterwards, can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way countervaile. And it is not amiſſe to obſerve how ſmall and mean faculties, if they fall into Great men, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Great matters, doe ſometimes work Great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant effects. <hi>Hereof we</hi> will ſet downe a memorable example, which we the rather note, becauſe the Jeſuites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem not to deſpiſe this kind of Diſcipline; in our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon ſound judgement, and it is a matter, which if it be made profeſſory, is ignominious, if diſciplinary, one of the beſt qualities: <hi>We mean Action upon the ſtage; as that which ſtrengthens memory, moderates the tone and emphaſis of voice, and Pronunciation; compoſes the countenance and gesture to a Decorum, procures good aſſurance, and likewiſe inureth Youth to the faces of Men.</hi> The example ſhall be taken out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> of one <hi>Vibulenus,</hi> who had bin ſometimes an Actor upon the ſtage, but at that time a common ſouldier in the Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Garriſons. This fellow upon the death of Auguſtus had rais'd a mutiny, ſo that <hi>Blaeſus</hi> the Livetenant, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of the mutiners to Priſon; but the ſouldiers by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent impreſsion brake open the Priſons, and ſet them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; &amp; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ibulenus</hi> about to make a Tribunitiall ſpeech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Souldiers, began in this manner,<note place="margin">Annal. 1.</note> 
                  <q>You have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven light and life, to theſe poore innocent wretches; but who reſtores my brother to me, or life unto my brother,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150781:226"/> that was ſent hether in meſſage from the Legions of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, to treate of the common cauſe, and he hath mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him this laſt night by ſome of his Fencers, that he hath about him for his executioners upon ſouldiers. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>Blaeſus,</hi> where haſt thou thrown his body? the moſt mortall enimies, doe not deny buriall: when I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed my laſt duties unto the corpes with kiſſes, with tears, command me to be ſlaine beſides him; ſo that theſe my fellowes for our good meaning, and our true hearts to the Legions, may have leave to bury us.</q> With which ſpeech, he put the Army into ſuch an infinite fury and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze, that if it had not incontinently appeard, that there was no ſuch matter, and that he never had any brother; the Souldiers would hardly have ſpared the Lievetenants life; for he played it merely, as if it had bin ſome interlude upon the Stage.</p>
               <p>§ Now we are come to a period of our Treatiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Rationall knowledges;</hi> wherein if we have ſometimes departed from the <hi>receiv'd partitions,</hi> yet let no man think that we diſallow all thoſe <hi>Partitions</hi> which we have not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: for there is a double neceſsity impoſed upon us, of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the <hi>Diviſions; The one becauſe theſe two, namely to ſort togither thoſe things which are next in nature, and to caſt into one Pile thoſe things which are next in uſe; are in their end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe altogiter differing.</hi> For example; A Secretary of a Prince or of Eſtate, ſo digeſts his Papers, without doubt, in his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as he may ſort togither things of like nature, as Treaties apart, Inſtructions apart, Forraine letters, Domeſtique let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all apart by themſelves; on the contrary in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cabinet, he ſorts togither thoſe that he were like to uſe togither, though of ſeverall nature: ſo in this generall <hi>Cabinet of knowledge,</hi> we were to ſet downe <hi>Partitions</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of things themſelves; whereas if any particular ſcience were to be handled, we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the diviſions fitteſt for uſe and practice. <hi>The other reaſon of changing the Diviſion is, becauſe the adjection of Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients to Sciences; and the reduction of them into an intire Body,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:150781:226"/> did by conſequence, alter the Partition of the Sciences themſelves.</hi> For ſay the Arts which are extant (for demonſtration ſake) be in number 15. and the Deficients ſuperadded make up the number 20. I ſay that the Parts of 15. are not the parts of 20, for the parts of 15. are 3. and 5. but the parts of 20. are 2. 4. 5. and 10. ſo is it plaine theſe could not otherwiſe be. And ſo much of <hi>Logicall Sciences.</hi>

Freed therefore by happy fate from this doctrine, which was the <hi>Heathens Heaven</hi> (wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, they attributed a higher elevation of mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than it was capeable of; for we ſee in what a height of ſtile <hi>Seneca</hi> writes,<note place="margin">In Epiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>verè Magnum habere fragilitatem hominis, ſecuritatem Dei</hi>) we may certainly with leſſe loſſe of ſobriety and Truth, receive for moſt part, the reſt of their inquiries concerning the doctrine of the <hi>Platforme.</hi> As concerning the <hi>Nature of Good Poſitive and Simple,</hi> ſurely they have ſet it out in beautifull colours and drawne it to the life, upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Tables; repreſenting with exact diligence to the eye, <hi>the Formes, Poſtures, Kinds, Affinities, Parts, Subjects, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, Actions, Adminiſtrations of virtues and Duties.</hi> Nor doe they ſo leave the purſuit; for they have commended and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated all theſe into the ſpirit of man, with great quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vivacity of Arguments, and ſweetneſſe, and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Perſwaſions; yea and fortified and intrenched the ſame (as much as diſcours can doe) againſt corrupt and populare opinions and invaſions. <hi>As touching the nature of comparative good,</hi> they have alſo well handled that, in ſetting downe that <hi>triplicite Order of Good,</hi> in <hi>comparing contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life with Active; in diſtinguiſhing between virtue with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctation, and virtue ſetled by ſecurity and confirmed: in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict and encounter; between honeſty and profit; in the ballancing of virtue with virtue, to ſee which preponderates other;</hi> and the like. So as this part touching the <hi>Platforme;</hi> I finde excellently la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, and that the ancients herein have ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:150781:229"/> admirable men: yet ſo as the pious and painfull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Divines, being practis'd in <hi>Duties, Morall virtues, Caſes of Conſcience, and circumſcriptions of ſinne,</hi> have farre out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the Philoſophers. <hi>Notwithſtanding</hi> (to returne to the Philoſophers) if before they had addreſs'd themſelves to the popular and reciv'd notions of <hi>Virtue, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ice, Paine, Pleaſure,</hi> and the reſt; they had ſtayd a litle longer and had ſearched the <hi>Rootes of Good and Evill, and the ſtrings of thoſe Rootes;</hi> they had given in my judgement a great light unto all which might fall into enquirie afterwards: eſpecially if they had conſulted as well with the <hi>Nature of things, as with the Axioms of Moralitie,</hi> they had made their Doctrines leſſe prolixe, and more profounde: which being by them eyther altogither omitted, or very confuſedly handled, wee will briefely reexamine and endeavour to open and cleare the ſprings of <hi>Morall habits,</hi> before we come unto the doctrine of the <hi>Culture or Manurance of the Minde,</hi> which we ſet downe as DEFICIENT.</p>
               <p n="2">II. There is imbred and imprinted in every thing an appetite to a <hi>duple Nature of Good: the One as everything is a Totall or Subſtantive in it ſelfe; the other as it is a part or membre of ſome greater Totall:</hi> and this <hi>latter</hi> is more excellent and potent than the <hi>other,</hi> becauſe it tendeth to the conſervation of a more <hi>ample forme. The first may be called Jndividuall or ſelfe-Good; the latter the Good of Communion. Jron</hi> in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sympathie moves to the <hi>Loadſtone,</hi> but yet if it exceed a certaine Quantitie, it forſakes thoſe affections, and like a good Citizen &amp; a true Patriot moves to the Earth, which is the Region and Country of its connaturalls. To proceed a litle further; <hi>Denſe</hi> and <hi>Maſſie Bodies</hi> move to the earth, to the great Congregation of <hi>cloſe-compacted Bodies;</hi> yet rather than to ſuffer a divulſion in the continuance of nature, and that there ſhould be, as they call it, a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> theſe Bodies will move upwards, forſaking their dutie to the <hi>Earth,</hi> that they may performe the generall duty they owe unto the <hi>World.</hi> So it is ever ſeen <hi>that the Conſervation of the more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and publique forme, commands and governs the leſſer and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:150781:230"/> more particular Appetites and Inclinations.</hi> But this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the <hi>Good of Communion,</hi> is eſpecially engraven upon Man, if he degenerate not according to that memorable ſpeech of <hi>Pompeius Magnus,</hi> who being in Commiſsion for purveyance for a Famine at Rome, and being diſſwaded with great vehemence and inſtance by his friends that hee would not hazard himſelfe to Sea in an extremitie of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he anſwered only this, <hi>Neceſſe eſt ut eam, non ut vivam.</hi> So as the love of life which in every Individuall Creature is ſo predominant an affection, could not out-ballance his love and loyaltie to the ſtate. But why doe we dwell upon this Point? There was never extant in any age of the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Philoſophy, or Sect, or Religion, or Law, or Diſcipline which hath ſo highly exalted the <hi>Good of Communion</hi> and depreſs'd <hi>Good private and particular,</hi> as the <hi>Holy Christian Faith,</hi> whereby it cleerely appeares, that it was one and the ſame <hi>God</hi> that gave the Chriſtian Law to Men, who gave thoſe Lawes of Nature to Creatures of inferior order. Wherefore we read that many of the elect Saints of God have rather wiſhed themſelves anathematiz'd and raz'd out of the <hi>Book of Life</hi> than that their brethren ſhould not attain ſalvation;<note place="margin">Rom. IX.</note> provoked through an extaſie of Charitie and an infinite feeling of the <hi>Good of Communion.</hi> This being ſet down and ſtrongly planted, doth judge and determine many of the profoundeſt Controverſies in <hi>Morall Philoſophie.</hi> For firſt, it decideth the Queſtion <hi>touching the preferment of the Contemplative or Active life;</hi> and that againſt the opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle:</hi> for all the reaſons which he brings for the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative,</hi> reſpect a <hi>private Good,</hi> and the pleaſure and dignitie of an Individuall onely; in which reſpects (no queſtion) a <hi>Contemplatixe life</hi> hath the preheminence. For the <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life</hi> is not much unlike to that compariſon to which <hi>Pythagoras</hi> made for the gracing and magnifying of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophie</hi> and <hi>Contemplation;</hi> who being askt by <hi>Hiero</hi> what he was, anſwered; <q>That if Hiero were ever at the Olympian Games,<note place="margin">Iamb. in vita.</note> he knew the manner that ſome came to trie their fortunes for the prizes; and ſome came as Merchants to utter their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities;
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:150781:230"/> and ſome came to make good cheere, to be merry, and to meet with their friends; and ſome came to look, on and that hee was one of them that came to look on.</q> But men muſt know that in this Theatre of Mans life, it is reſerved onley for God and Angels, to be Lookers on. Neither ſurely could it have bin that any doubt, touching this point, ſhould ever have bin rais'd in the Church (notwithſtanding that ſaying was frequent in many mens Mouths,<note place="margin">Pſal.

               <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Herefore let us now reſume and proſecute firſt <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>Particulare Good:</hi> we will divide it into <hi>Good Active</hi> and <hi>Good Paſsive,</hi> for this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Good</hi> (not unlike ſurely to thoſe Appellations, which amongſt the Romans, were familiar in their Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Termes of <hi>Promus</hi> and <hi>Condus</hi>) is found impreſs'd in the whole courſe of Nature: but chiefly diſcloſeth it ſelfe in the two ſeverall Appetites of Creatures; the one of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and fortifying</hi> themſelves; the other of <hi>multiplying and dilating</hi> themſelves; and this latter which is <hi>Active,</hi> and as it were, the <hi>Promus</hi> ſeems to be the more powerfull and the more worthy; but the former which is <hi>Paſsive,</hi> and, as it were, the <hi>Condus,</hi> may be taken as inferior and leſſe worthy. For in the univerſal frame of Nature, the Heavenly nature is chiefly the <hi>Agent;</hi> the Terreſtriall nature the <hi>Patient:</hi> ſo in the Pleaſures of living Creatures, the pleaſure of Generation is greater, then that of Nutrition: and in the divine Oracles it is pronounced,<note place="margin">Act. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Beatiùs eſſe dare quam accipere.</hi> Nay farther, in the common courſe of life, there is no mans ſpirit ſo ſoft and effeminate, but eſtimes the effecting, and bringing to ſome iſſue that which he hath fixt in his deſire; more than any ſenſuality or pleaſure. And certainly this preheminence of <hi>Active Good,</hi> is infinitely exalted from the conſideration of our humane condition, that it is mortal, and alſo expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the ſtroak of Fortune: for if there could be obtained, a licence of perpetuity and certainty in humane Pleaſures, their price would be advanced, for their ſecurity and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. And in as much as we ſee, that the ſumme of all
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:150781:232"/> comes to this, <hi>Magni aeſtimamus mori tardius; Et ne glorieris de crastino, neſcis partum Diei;</hi> it is no wonder if with all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſpirit, we purſue thoſe things, which are ſecur'd and exempt from the injuries and affronts of time: and theſe things can be nothing elſe but only our <hi>deeds,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>opera eorum ſequuntur eos.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. XIV.</note>
               </p>
               <p>§ There is likewiſe another preheminence of <hi>Good Active,</hi> of import implanted in, and ſupported by that affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which cleaves cloſe to mans nature, as an individuate companion; which is the <hi>love of Novelty and Variety:</hi> and this <hi>Affection</hi> in the pleaſures of the ſences (which are the very principall part of <hi>Paſsive Good</hi>) is exceeding narrow and hath no great latitude: <hi>Doe but think</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) how often you have acted over the ſame things, Meat, Sleep, Mirth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sen. de bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. vitae.</note> 
                  <hi>we runne round in this circle, to be willing to dye; not only a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, or a wretched, or a wiſe man may, but even a faſtidious and nice nature may.</hi> But in the Enterpriſes, Purpoſes and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of our life, there is much variety, whereof we are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in our inceptions, progreſsions, reſts, recoiles, to redin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrate our forces, approaches, attainings and the like; ſo as it was very well ſaid, <hi>vita ſine Propoſito languida &amp; vaga est:</hi> which indifferently befalls both to the wiſe and unwiſe, as ſaith <hi>Solomon, A light-brain'd man, ſeeks to ſatisfy his fancy, and intermixeth himſelfe in all things.</hi> Nay we ſee likewiſe, that many great Princes, who may have at command whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may delight the Sences, notwithſtanding many times, have procured to themſelves poore deſires, and ſet their hearts upon toies; (as <hi>Nero, in playing upon the Harpe; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modus in playing at Fence; Antoninus in driving Chariots,</hi> and others taken up with other delights) which to them were more acceptable than all the affluence of ſenſuall Pleaſures: <hi>ſo much great refreſhing and contentment it is, to goe forward in Action, than to stand at a ſtay in fruition.</hi> This in the mean is to be ſomewhat more diligently noted, that this <hi>Active indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall Good,</hi> altogither differs from the <hi>good of Society,</hi> though oftentimes they are coincident; for although that <hi>Particular Active Good,</hi> doth many times breed, and bring
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:150781:233"/> forth <hi>Acts of Beneficence,</hi> which is <hi>a virtue of Communion;</hi> yet here's the difference, that thoſe Acts are by moſt men perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not with intention to benefit and make happy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but meerely in a private reſpect to themſelves, &amp; their own power and amplification. This beſt appeares when <hi>Good Active</hi> lights upon a ſubject which is contrary to the <hi>Good of Communion:</hi> for that Gigantive ſtate of minde which poſſeſſeth the troublers of the world (ſuch as was <hi>L. Sylla,</hi> and infinite others, thoe in a far ſmaller Modell) who ſeeme to endeavour this, to have all men happy or unhappy as they were their Friends or Enimies, and that the world might beare their ſtamp and be formd to their humours (which is the true <hi>Theomachie,</hi>) this I ſay, aſpires to <hi>Active Particulare Good,</hi> at leaſt in appearance, altho it doth moſt of all recede from the <hi>Good of Societie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. But we will divide <hi>Paſsive Good</hi> into <hi>Good Conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> and <hi>Good Perfective.</hi> For there is implanted in every thing a triple Appetite in reſpect of <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>Particular Good; the firſt of preſerving or continuing it ſelfe; the ſecond of advancing and perfecting it ſelfe; the third of multiplying and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it ſelfe:</hi> but this laſt Appetite is referr'd to <hi>Active Good,</hi> whereof we ſpake even now. There remaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the two other kindes of <hi>Good,</hi> of which the <hi>Perfective</hi> excells; for it is leſſe to conſerve a thing in its naturall ſtate, but greater to advance the ſame thing to a higher nature; for there are found through all Eſſences ſome nobler na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the dignity and excellency whereof inferiour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe aſpire, as to their originals and ſprings. So concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Men, the Poet doth not impertinently deſcribe,
<q>
                     <note place="margin">Virg. Aen. 6</note>Igneus eſt Ollis vigor &amp; Coeleſtis Origo;</q> Mans aſſumption or approach to a divine or Angelicall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the perfection of his Forme; a depraved and prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous imitation of which <hi>Perfective Good,</hi> is the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of humane life and a violent Tempeſt which beares downe and ruines all, that is, while men inſteed of a formal and eſſential advancement are carried in a blinde Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to an Advancement onely Locall. <hi>For as thoſe</hi> which are
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:150781:233"/> ſick and finde no Remedie, doe tumble up and downe and change place, as if by a remove Locall, they could obtaine a remove internall, and ſhift of their diſeaſe: ſo it is in Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that men being poſſeſs'd, and led away with a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of exalting their nature, purchaſe nothing elſe but an eminence and celſitude of <hi>Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ But <hi>Good Conſervative</hi> is no other then <hi>the reception and fruition of things agreeable to our Nature;</hi> and this <hi>Good</hi> tho it bee moſt ſimple and Native; yet ſeemes it to be of all other kinds of <hi>Good</hi> the ſofteſt and loweſt. And this <hi>Good</hi> alſo admits a difference, which hath neither bin well judg'd of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor well inquired; for the <hi>Good of Fruition,</hi> or (as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called) the dignitie and commendation <hi>of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Good,</hi> is placed either in the <hi>Syncerity of the Fruition,</hi> or in the <hi>quickneſſe and vigor</hi> of it; whereof the one is ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by <hi>Equality;</hi> the other by <hi>Variety</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iciſcitude:</hi> the one having a leſſe mixture of <hi>Evill;</hi> the other a more ſtrong and lively impreſsion of <hi>Good.</hi> But of theſe, <hi>whether is the greater Good,</hi> is a queſtion controverted; But <hi>whether a mans nature may be capable of both at once, is a queſtion not inquired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ As touching that whereof a Queſtion is rais'd: a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie began to be debated between <hi>Socrates</hi> and a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt; Socrates</hi> affirm'd;<note place="margin">Plato in Gorg.</note> 
                  <hi>That Felicitie was placed in a constant Peace and Tranquility of minde;</hi> but the Sophiſt in this, <hi>That a man deſire much, and enjoy much.</hi> And ſo they fell from Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to ill words; the Sophiſts ſaying <hi>that Socrates Felicity was the Felicity of a block or stone; Socrates</hi> on the other ſide, <hi>That the Sophiſts Felicitie was the Felicitie of one that had the Jtch, who did nothing but itch and ſcratch.</hi> And both theſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions doe not want their ſupports; for to <hi>Socrates</hi> opinion aſſents even the Schoole of <hi>Epicurus</hi> which deemes not but that Virtue beareth a great part in Felicitie; and if ſo, <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtue hath more uſe in cleering Perturbations, then in compaſsing deſires.</hi> The Sophiſts opinion is much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the aſſertion we laſt ſpake of; namely that <hi>Good Perfective is greater than Good Preſervative, becauſe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of things deſired, ſeemes by degrees to perfit nature; which
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:150781:234"/> though it doe not doe it indeed, yet the very motion it ſelfe in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle hath a ſhew of Progreſſive Motion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ But the ſecond Queſtion, <hi>(whether humane nature may not at once retaine, both the tranquilitie of Minde and the active vigor of fruition)</hi> decided the true way makes the former idle and ſuperfluous. For doe we not often ſee that ſome men are ſo fram'd and compoſed by nature, as they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely affected with pleaſures while they are preſent; and yet are not greatly troubled at the leaving or loſſe of them. So as the Philoſophicall conſequence, <hi>Non uti, ut non appetas, non appetere ut non metuas,</hi> ſeemes to be the reſolution of a poore and diffident ſpirit,. Surely moſt of the Doctrines of Philoſophers ſeeme to be ſomewhat more fearefull &amp; cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary, then the nature of things requireth; as when they encreaſe the feare of death by curing it: for when they would have a mans whole life to be but a diſcipline or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to die; how can it be that that enimie ſhould not ſeeeme wonderfull terrible, againſt whom there is no end of preparing? better ſaith the Poet thoe a Heathen,

                     <note place="margin">Iuven. Satir. 10.</note>Qui ſpacium vitae extremum, inter munera ponat Naturae.—</q> So have the Philoſophers ſought to make the Minde in all things uniforme and Harmonicall; by not breaking them to contrary Motions and extremes. The reaſon whereof I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to have bin, becauſe they dedicated themſelves to a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate courſe of life; exempt &amp; free from active imploiments and obſervances to others. But let men rather imitate the wiſdome of Iewellers, who, if perchance, there be in the Gemme a Cloud or an Ice, which may ſo be ground forth, as it abate not the ſtone too much, they help it, otherwiſe they will not meddle with it: ſo ought men ſo to procure <hi>Sereni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of minde as they deſtroy not <hi>Magnanimitie.</hi> Thus much of <hi>Particulare Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. Now therefore after we have ſpoken of <hi>Selfe-good</hi> (which alſo we uſe to call <hi>Good Particular, Private, Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall,</hi> let us reſume the <hi>Good of Communion,</hi> which reſpecteth <hi>Society,</hi> This is commonly termed by the name of <hi>Duty,</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:150781:234"/> becauſe the terme of <hi>Duty,</hi> is more proper to a mind well fram'd and diſpos'd towards others; the terme of <hi>Virtue,</hi> to a mind well form'd and compos'd in it ſelfe. But this part at firſt ſight may ſeeme to pertaine to <hi>Science Civile,</hi> or <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique,</hi> but not if it be well obſerved; for it concernes the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment and Government of every man over himſelfe, and not over others. <hi>And as in Architecture,</hi> it is one thing, to frame the Poſts, Beams, and other parts of an Edifice, and to prepare them for the uſe of building; and another thing, to fit and joyne the ſame parts togither: and as in Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls, the direction how to frame, and make an inſtrument or engine, is not the ſame with the manner of erecting, moving, and ſetting it on work: So the doctrine of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugation of men, in a <hi>Citty or Society,</hi> differs from that which makes them conformed, and well affected to the weale of ſuch a <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ This Part of Duties is likewiſe diſtributed into two portions, whereof the one reſpects the <hi>common duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man;</hi> the other <hi>the ſpeciall and reſpective Duties,</hi> of every man in his profeſsion, vocation, ſtate, perſon, and place. The firſt of theſe, hath bin well laboured, and diligently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated by the Ancients and others, as hath bin ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we find to have bin ſparſedly handled, althoe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted into an entire body of a <hi>Science;</hi> which manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed kind of writing, we doe not diſlike; howbeit in our judgement, to have written of this Argument by parts, were farre better. For who is endewed with ſo much perſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and confidence, as that he can take upon him to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and make a judgement skilfully, and to the life, of the <hi>peculiar and reſpective duties,</hi> of every particular order, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and profeſsion? <hi>And the treatiſes which are not ſeaſond with experience, but are drawne only from a generall and Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticall notion of things, are touching ſuch matters, for moſt part, idle and fruitleſſe diſcourſes.</hi> For althoe ſometimes a loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker on may ſee more then a gameſter; and there be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon proverbe, more arrogant than ſound, proceeding from the cenſure of the vulgar, touching the actions of Princes,

                  <note n="✿" place="margin">SATYRA SERIA, ſive de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terioribus rerum.</note> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>knowledge,</hi> as it were, Relative and Oppoſite unto the former, concerning the <hi>Fraudes, Cautels, Impoſtures,</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of every Profeſsion:</hi> For Corruptions and Vices, are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Duties and Virtues. Nor are theſe <hi>Depravations</hi> altogither ſilenced in many writings and Tractates; but for moſt part, theſe are noted only upon the By, and that by way of Digreſsion: but how? rather in a Satyre and Cyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally after <hi>Lucians</hi> manner, than ſeriouſly and gravely, for men have rather ſought by wit to traduce, and to expoſe to
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:150781:236"/> ſcorne that which is uſefull and ſound, in Arts and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; than to ſever that which is good and wholſome, from that which is corrupt and vicious. But <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith excellently;<note place="margin">Prov. XIV.</note> 
                  <hi>A ſcorner ſeeks wiſdome and findes it not; but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is eaſy unto him that underſtands:</hi> for he that comes to ſeek after knowledge, with a mind to ſcorne, and cenſure; ſhall be ſure to find matter for his humor, but no matter for his inſtruction. And certainly a grave and wiſe Treatiſe of this argument, whereof we now ſpeak, and that with ſincerity and integrity, ſeemeth worthy to be reckoned one of the beſt fortifications of virtue and honeſty, that can be planted. <hi>For as the Fable goes</hi> of the Baſiliske, that if he ſee a man firſt, the man dies; but if a man ſee him firſt, the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiliske dies; ſo it is with Fraudes, Impoſtures, and evill Arts; if a man diſcover them firſt, they looſe their power of doing hurt; but if they prevent, then, and not otherwiſe, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger. So that we are much beholding to <hi>Machiavill,</hi> and ſuch writers, who diſcover apertly and plainly, what men uſe to doe, not what men ought to doe: for it is not poſsible to joyne the <hi>wiſdome of the Serpent, with the Innocency of the Dove,</hi> except a man know exactly the nature of evill it ſelfe; for without this skill, virtue lies open and unfencd; nay a ſincere and honeſt man, can doe no good upon thoſe that are wicked, to reclaime them, unleſſe he know all the coverts and profundities of Malice. For men of corrupt minds and deprav'd judgements, preſuppoſe, that honeſty growes out of the weakneſſe of Nature, and ſimplicity of Manners, and only out of a beliefe given to Preachers and Schoole-Maſters; as likewiſe to Books; Morall Precepts; and popular opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that unleſſe you can make them plainly to perceive, that their deprav'd and corrupt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and crooked Rules, are as deeply ſounded, and as plainly diſcovered, by thoſe who exhort and admoniſh them, as they are to themſelves, they deſpiſe all the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of Morall Practices or Precepts; according to that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Oracle of <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 18.</note>

                  <hi>look perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the Miſtreſſe;</hi> and yet no doubt many things are left to the diſcretion and care of the Hand-maid; ſo ought <hi>Morall Philoſophy</hi> to give all due obſervance to Divinity, and to be obſequious to hir Precepts; yet ſo, as it may yeeld of it ſelfe, within its own limits, many ſound and profitable directions. <hi>This Part therefore,</hi> when I ſeriouſly conſider the excellency thereof, I can not but find exceeding ſtrange, that it is not yet reduced into <hi>a Body of Knowledge.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing we have reported it as DEFICIENT, we will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our manner give ſome Adumbrations thereof.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Firſt therefore,</hi> in this as in all things which are Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall, we ought to caſt up our account, <hi>what is in our power,</hi>

Yet even in thoſe things which are not in our power, no leſſe diligent inquiry is to be made thereof, then in thoſe which are ſubject to our power; for a diſtinct and exact knowledge of them, is to be laid as a ground-work to the <hi>knowledge of the Remedies;</hi> that they may be more aptly and ſucceſſefully applied; for neither can a garment be well fitted to the Body, unleſſe you firſt take the meaſure of the Body.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>Wherefore</hi> the firſt article of this knowledge <hi>of the Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Mind,</hi> ſhall be converſant about the <hi>diverſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of mens natures or diſpoſitions.</hi> Neither doe we here ſpeak of thoſe common Proclivities to virtues and vices; or Perturbations and paſsions: but of thoſe which are more intrinſique and radicall. Surely for this part of knowledge, I doe much wonder that it ſhould be, for moſt part, ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected or ſlightly paſt over, by writers Moral and Political; conſidering it caſts ſuch reſplendent beams upon both thoſe kinds of knowledges. In the Traditions of <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> the natures &amp; diſpoſitions of men, are not without ſome colour of truth, diſtinguiſht from the Praedominancies of Planets; as that ſome are by nature made and proportioned for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation;</hi> others for <hi>matters Civile;</hi> others for <hi>Warre;</hi> others for <hi>Advancement;</hi> others for <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> others for <hi>Arts;</hi> others for changeable courſe of life. So among the Poets, Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, Satyricall, Tragedians, Comedians, you ſhall finde e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, the Images of wits, althoe commonly with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and beyound the bounds of Truth. Nay this ſame Argument of the <hi>divers Characters of Nature,</hi> is one of thoſe ſubjects, wherein the common diſcourſes of men, (which very ſeldome, yet ſometimes falls out) are more wiſe then Books. But the beſt proviſion and collection for ſuch a treatiſe, ought to be fetcht from the obſervations of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſort of Hiſtorians; not only from Elogies and Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riques, which commonly follow the death of a Perſon; but much more from the entire body of a Hiſtory, ſo often as ſuch a perſonage doth, as it were, enter upon the ſtage. For this inter-woven Image, ſeems to be a more lively deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:150781:238"/> than the cenſure of an Elogy; ſuch as is that in <hi>T. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, of Africanus,</hi> and of <hi>Cato the Elder; in Tacitus of Tiberius, Claudius and Nero; in Herodian, of Septimius Severus; in Philip de Commines, of Lewis the XI.</hi> K. of France; <hi>in Fra. Guicciar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, of Ferdinand King of Spaine; Maximilian the Emperour; Leo and Clemens, Biſhops of Rome.</hi> For thoſe writers fixing their eyes continually on the Images of theſe Perſons, whom they made choice of to decipher, and purtrait, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome mention their Acts and Atchievements, but withall, inſert ſomething touching their nature and diſpoſitions; ſo likewiſe many <hi>Relations, touching the Conclaves of Popes,</hi> which we have met withall, repreſent <hi>good Characters, and lively impreſsions,</hi> of the naturall diſpoſitions of <hi>Cardinalls;</hi> as the letters of Ambaſſadors, ſet forth the nature and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Counſilors to Princes. Wherefore let there be a full, and perfect collection made of this argument, whereof we have ſpoken, which certainly is fertile and copious. <hi>Neither would we,</hi> that thoſe <hi>Characters</hi> in the <hi>Ethiques</hi> (as it is with Hiſtorians, Poets, and in common ſpeech,) ſhould be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as perfit politique Images; but rather as the firſt draughts and rude lineaments of thoſe Images, which compounded and commixt, conſtitute any reſemblances whatſoever; how many and of what ſort they may be; and how they are connext and ſubordinate one with another: that there may be made, as it were, an artificiall and accurate diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of natures and diſpoſitions; and a diſcovery of the ſecret inclinations of Individual tempers; and that from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, precepts of cure may be more pertinently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</p>
               <p>§ And not only the <hi>Characters of diſpoſitions,</hi> impreſſed by nature, ſhould be received into this Tractate, but thoſe alſo which are impoſed upon the mind, from Sex, Age, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Health, Beauty, and the like: as alſo thoſe from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne fortune, as of Princes, Nobles, obſcure Perſons; Rich, Poore, Private perſons, Proſperous, Miſerable, and the like.

               <p n="2">II. <hi>After the knowledge of Characters</hi> followes the <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Paſsions,</hi> which are as the <hi>Diſeaſes of the Mind,</hi> as hath bin ſaid. For as the Ancient Politiques in Populare States were wont to ſay, <hi>That the people were like the Sea, and the Orators like the windes;</hi> becauſe as the <hi>Sea</hi> would of it ſelfe be calme and quiet, if the <hi>winds</hi> did not move and trouble it; ſo the <hi>People</hi> of their nature would be peaceable and tractable, if the <hi>ſeditious Orators</hi> did not ſet them in working and agitation. So it may be truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that <hi>mans mind</hi> in the nature thereof, would be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:150781:239"/> and ſtaid, if the <hi>affections</hi> as windes, did not put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tumult and perturbation. And here againe I finde it ſtrange, that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who writ ſo many books of <hi>Ethiques,</hi> ſhould never in them, handle the <hi>Affections,</hi> as an eſſentiall member of <hi>Ethiques;</hi> and yet in the <hi>Rhetoriques</hi> where they are conſidered but Collaterally, and in a ſecond degree (that is ſo farre as they may be rais'd and moved by ſpeech) he findes place for them, (in which place notwithſtanding, for ſuch an abridgement, he diſcourſeth acutely and well,) for his diſputations about <hi>pleaſure and paine,</hi> no way ſatisfy this inquiry; no more than he that ſhould write only of <hi>light</hi> and <hi>lightening,</hi> could be ſaid, to have written of the nature of <hi>particular Colours;</hi> for <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Paine,</hi> are to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affections, as <hi>light</hi> is to <hi>Colours.</hi> Better travailes the Stoiques have taken in this argument, as farre as may be conjectured from ſuch Remaines as are extant; but yet ſuch as conſiſted rather in curioſity of Definitions, than any full and ample deſcriptions. So likewiſe I find ſome elegant Bookes of ſome <hi>affections,</hi> as of <hi>Anger, of tenderneſſe, of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> and ſome few other. But to ſpeak the truth, the beſt Doctors of <hi>this knowledge</hi> are the Poets, and writers of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, where we may finde painted and diſſected to the life, how affections are to be ſtirred up and kindled; how ſtill'd and laid a ſleep; how againe containd and refrain'd, that they break not forth into Act? likewiſe how they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe themſelves thoe repreſſed and ſecreted? what operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they produce? what turnes they take? how they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapt one within another? how they fight and encounter one with another? and other the like Particularities. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the which, this laſt is of ſpeciall uſe in Morale and Civile matters, <hi>How I ſay, to ſet Affection against Affection; and by the helpe of one to maſter and reclaime another?</hi> After the manner of Hunters and Fowlers, who hunt Beaſt with Beaſt; and fly Bird with Bird; which percaſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the aſsiſtance of Bruit Creatures, a man could not ſo eaſily recover. Nay farther, upon this foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is erected that excellent and univerſall uſe in matters
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:150781:240"/> Civile of <hi>Praemium</hi> and <hi>Poena,</hi> which are the <hi>Pillars of Civile States;</hi> ſeeing thoſe <hi>predominant Affections</hi> of <hi>Feare</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> doe bridle &amp; ſuppreſſe all other exorbitant <hi>Affections.</hi> Again, as in goverment of States, it is ſometimes neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front and bridle one Faction with another; ſo it is in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Goverment of the Minde.</hi>

               <p n="3">III Now come we to thoſe Points which are <hi>within our own commande,</hi> and have force and operation upon the mind, and alſo affect, diſpoſe, and manage the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Appetite;</hi> and therefore are of great force to alter the manners. In which part the Philoſophers ought to have made a paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diligent <hi>Inquirie</hi> touching the <hi>Power and Energie of Cuſtome, Exerciſe, Habit, Education, Converſation, Friendſhip, Praiſe, Reprehenſion, Exhortation, Fame, Laws, Books, Studies,</hi> and other points of like nature. <hi>Theſe</hi> are <hi>they</hi> which have the ſway and dominion in <hi>Moralitie;</hi> from theſe Agents the mind ſuffereth and is diſpoſed; of theſe, as of Ingredients, receits are compounded, which conduce to the conſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and recovery of the Health and good eſtate of the Minde as far as may bee performed by Humane Remedies. Of which number we will ſelect one or two whereupon wee will a litle inſiſt as an example to the reſt. We will therefore inſinuate a few points <hi>touching Cuſtome</hi> and <hi>Habit.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Moral. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. lib. 2.</note>That opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeemeth to me to ſavour of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and a narrow Contemplation, where he aſſerts—<hi>that thoſe Actions which are naturall can not be changd by cuſtome;</hi> uſing for example—<hi>that if a stone be throwne a thouſand times up, it will not learne to aſcend of its own accord: Moreover, that by often ſeeing or hearing, we doe not learne to heare or ſee the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> for though this principle be true in ſome things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Nature is Peremptotory (the reaſons whereof wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now ſtand to diſcuſſe) yet it is otherwiſe in things wherein Nature according to a <hi>Latitude</hi> admits <hi>intention</hi> and <hi>remiſſion.</hi> He might ſee that a ſtraight glove by often drawing on, is made wider; and that a wand by uſe and continuance is bowed contrary to its naturall bent in the growth, and ſoone after ſtayes in the ſame poſture; that the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:150781:240"/> voice by exercizing it becomes louder and ſtronger; that heat and cold are better endur'd by cuſtome; and many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of like kinde. Which two latter examples have a neerer reſemblance and come neerer to the point, than thoſe he there alleadgeth. But however this caſe be determin'd, by how much the more true it is; <hi>that both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtues and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ices conſist in habit;</hi> he ought, by ſo much the more, to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, to have ſo preſcrib'd rules <hi>how ſuch habits might be acquired, or remov'd:</hi> for there may be many Precepts made of the wiſe ordering of the <hi>Exerciſes of the Minde,</hi> no leſſe then of the <hi>Exerciſes of the Body;</hi> whereof wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a few.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>The firſt ſhall be; that we beware even at firſt of higher or ſmaller taskes, than the nature of the buſineſſe requires, or our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or abilities permit:</hi> For if too great a taske be impos'd, in a meane diffident nature, you blunt the edge of cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and blaſt their hopes; in a nature full of Confidence, you breed an opinion whereby a man promiſeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe more than he is able to performe; which drawes on ſloath and ſecurity; and in both thoſe temperatures, it will come to paſſe that the experiment doth not ſatisfie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation; which ever diſcourageth and confounds the minde: but if the Tasks be too weake and eaſie, in the ſumme of proceeding there is a loſſe and prejudice.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>A ſecond ſhall be; that to the practiſing of any facultie, whereby a habit may be ſuperinduced, two Seaſons are chiefly to be obſerved, the one when the minde is beſt diſpoſed to a buſineſſe; the other when it is worſt:</hi> that by the one, we may be well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on our way; by the latter, we may by a ſtrenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention worke out the knots and ſtonds of the minde; which makes midle times to paſſe with more eaſe and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>A third Precept ſhall be that which Ariſtotle mentions by the way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moral. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. lib. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>which is to beare ever towards the contrary extreme of that whereunto we are by nature inclin'd, ſo it be without vice.</hi> Like as when we rowe againſt the ſtreame; or when wee make a crooked wand ſtraight by bending it the contrary way.</p>
               <pb n="358" facs="tcp:150781:241"/>
               <p>§ <hi>The Fourth Precept is grounded upon that Axiome which is moſt true. That the minde is brought to any thing with more ſweetneſſe and happineſſe if that whereunto we pretend, bee not principal in the intention of the Doer; but be overcome, as it were, doing ſomewhat elſe; becauſe the inſtinct of nature is ſuch a freedome as hates neceſsity and compulſive commands.</hi> Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rules there are which might profitably be preſcribed touching the <hi>Direction of Cuſtome:</hi> for <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> if it be wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and skilfully induced, <hi>proves</hi> (as it is commonly ſaid) <hi>an other nature;</hi> but being conducted abſurdly and by chance, <hi>it is only the Ape of Nature;</hi> which imitates nothing to the life, but in a fooliſh deformity onely.</p>
               <p>§ <hi>So if we ſhould</hi> ſpeake of <hi>Bookes</hi> and <hi>Studies,</hi> and of their power and influence upon Manners; are there not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Precepts and fruitfull Directions appertaining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto? Hath not one of the Fathers in great indignation cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Poeſie vinum Daemonum;</hi> being indeed it begets many Temptations, Luſts, and vaine Opinions? It is not a wiſe opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and worthy to be regarded: <hi>That young men are no fit auditors of Morall Philoſophy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moral. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. Lib. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe the boyling heat of their affections, is not yet ſetled, nor attemperd with Time and Experience.</hi> And to ſpeake truth, doth it not hereof come that thoſe excellent Books and Diſcourſes of ancient Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (whereby they have perſwaded unto virtue moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; repreſenting as well her ſtately Majeſtie to the eyes of the world, as expoſing to Scorne, popular Opinions in diſgrace of Virtue, attired as it were, in their <hi>Paraſite Coats</hi>) are of ſo litle effect towards honeſty of life and the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of corrupt Manners; becauſe they uſe not to be read and revolv'd by men mature in yeeres and judgement; but are left and confin'd onely to Boyes and Beginners. <hi>But is it not true alſo that young men are much leſſe fit Auditors of Policie than Moralitie,</hi> till they have bin throughly ſeaſon'd with <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the knowledge of Manners and Duties; leſt their judgements be corrupted and made apt to think that there are no <hi>Moral</hi> differences true and ſolid of things; but that all is to be valued according to a utilitie and fortune. As the Poet ſaith,
<q>
                     <pb n="359" facs="tcp:150781:241"/>Proſperum &amp; felixſcelus virtus vocatur.<note place="margin">Iuvenal. Sat. 13.</note>
                  </q> And againe,
<q>Ille crucem pretium ſceleris tulit, hic Diadema.</q> But the Poets ſeeme to ſpeak this Satyrically, and in indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; be it ſo, yet many Books of Policie doe ſuppoſe the ſame ſeriouſly and poſitively: for ſo it pleaſed <hi>Machiavell</hi> to ſay, <hi>That if Caeſar had bin overthrowne hee would have bin more odious than ever was Catiline;</hi> as if there had bin no difference but in <hi>fortune</hi> onely, between a very fury compoſed of Luſt and Blood, and the moſt excellent ſpirit (his ambition reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) in the world. By this we ſee how neceſſary it is, for men to drink deeply <hi>Pious and Morall knowledges,</hi> before they taſt <hi>Politique;</hi> for that they who are bred up in the Courts of Princes from tender yeeres, and in affaires of ſtate, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly never attaine an inward and ſyncere Probitie of Manners; how much further of from honeſtie, if to this fire of corrupt education there be adminiſtred the fewell of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Books? <hi>Againe,</hi> even in Morall inſtructions themſelves, or at leaſt in ſome of them is there not a Caution likewiſe to be given, leſt they make men too Preciſe, Arrogant, and Incompatible; according to that of <hi>Cicero</hi> touching <hi>M. Cato, Theſe Divine and excellent qualities which we ſee are his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per endowments, but ſuch as are ſometimes deficient in him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro L. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raena.</note> 
                  <hi>are all deriv'd from Teachers and not from Nature.</hi> There are many other Axioms touching thoſe properties and effects which Studies and Books doe inſtill into the mindes of men: for it is true that he ſaith, <hi>abeunt ſtudia in mores;</hi> which may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be affirm'd of thoſe other points touching <hi>Companie; Fame,</hi> the <hi>Lawes of our Countrey,</hi> and the reſt which a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we recited. But there is a kinde of <hi>Culture of the Minde</hi> which ſeemes yet more acurate and elaborate than the reſt, and is built upon this ground, <hi>That the mindes of all Mortals are at ſome certaine times in a more perfect ſtate; at other times in a more depraved state.</hi> The purpoſe therefore and direction of <hi>this Culture</hi> is, that thoſe good ſeaſons may be cheriſht, &amp; the evill croſt, and expunged out of the Kalender. <hi>The fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of good Times</hi> is procured by two meanes, by <hi>vowes or at</hi>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:150781:242"/> Leaſt <hi>most conſtant Reſolutions</hi> of the Mind; and by <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and exerciſes,</hi> which are not to be regarded ſo much in themſelves, as becauſe they keep the mind in her devoir and continuall obedience. The <hi>obliteration of evill Times</hi> may be in like manner perfected two waies; by ſome <hi>kind of Redemption or expiation of that which is past;</hi> and by a <hi>new courſe of life,</hi> as it were, <hi>turning over a clean leafe.</hi> But this part ſeems wholly to appertaine to Religion, and Juſtly, conſidering that true and genuine <hi>Morale Philoſophy,</hi> as was ſaid, ſupplies the place of a Hand-maid only to <hi>Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> wherefore we will conclude this part of the <hi>Culture of the Mind,</hi> with that remedy which of all other meanes is the moſt compendious and ſummary; and againe the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and effectuall, to the reducing of the mind to virtue, and the placing of it in a ſtate next to perfection: and this is, <hi>That we make choice of, and propound to our ſelves, right ends of life and Actions, and agreeing to virtue; which yet muſt be ſuch as may be in a reaſonable ſort within our compaſſe to attaine.</hi> For if theſe two things be ſuppos'd, <hi>that the ends of Actions be Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Good;</hi> and <hi>that the Reſolution of the mind, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing and obtaining them, be fixt, conſtant, and true unto ſuch ends;</hi> it will follow that the mind ſhall forthwith transforme and mould it ſelfe into all virtues at once. And this indeed is an operation, which reſembleth the <hi>work of nature,</hi> whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſes whereof we have ſpoken, are like the <hi>work of the hand.</hi> For as when a Carver cuts and graves an Image, he ſhapes only that part whereupon he works, and not the reſt; as if he be faſhioning the Face, the reſt of the Body is a rude and formeleſſe ſtone ſtill, till ſuch time as he come to it: but contrariwiſe, when <hi>Nature</hi> makes a Flower or <hi>Living Creature,</hi> ſhe ingenders and brings forth rudiments of all the parts at one time. So in obtaining virtues by <hi>habite,</hi> while a man practiſeth <hi>Temperance,</hi> he doth not profit much to <hi>Fortitude</hi> and the like; but when we wholly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and devote our ſelves to good and honeſt ends; look what virtue ſoever <hi>ſuch ends</hi> commends and commands, our mind unto, we ſhall find our ſelves already inveſted and
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:150781:242"/> prediſpoſited with a kind of hability and propenſion to purſue and expreſſe the ſame. And this may be that <hi>State of Mind</hi> which is excellently deſcribed by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Moral. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. lib. 7.</note> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the character, not of <hi>virtue,</hi> but a kind of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> his words are theſe; <hi>And with</hi> IMMANITY, <hi>we may not unaptly countre-ballance, that ability which is above humanity;</hi> HEROICK OR DIVINE VIRTUE: and a litle after, <hi>for as Savage Creatures are incapable of Vice or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>irtue; ſo is the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: but this ſtate is a thing higher than virtue; that, ſomewhat elſe than vice.</hi> Indeed <hi>Plinius Secundus,</hi> from the licence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then magniloquence, ſet forth the virtue of <hi>Trajane,</hi> not as an imitation, but as a patterne too divine, when he ſaith, <hi>That men need to make no other praires to the Gods, but that they would continue as good and as gracious Lords to them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paneg.</note> 
                  <hi>as Trajane had bin.</hi> But theſe are the prophane and unhallowed Aires of Heathens, who apprehend ſhadowes greater then the Body: but true Religion, and the Holy Chriſtian Faith, laies hold on the ſubſtance it ſelfe, imprinting upon mens Minds <hi>Charity,</hi> which is moſt properly called,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>The bond of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> becauſe it comprehends and faſtens all virtues togither. Surely it is elegantly ſaid by <hi>Menander</hi> of <hi>vaine Love,</hi> which is but a counterfeit imitation of <hi>Divine Love, Amor melior ſophiſtâ laevo, ad humanam vitam;</hi> by which words he inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, <hi>that good and decent cariage, is better learn'd from</hi> Love, <hi>then from a</hi> Sophiſt, <hi>or an innept Tutor;</hi> whom hee calls <hi>Left-handed,</hi> becauſe with all his tedious Rules and Precepts, he cannot forme a man ſo dexterouſly, and with that facility to value himſelfe, and governe himſelfe, as <hi>Love</hi> can doe. So certainly, if a mans mind be truly infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the <hi>heat of Charity,</hi> he ſhall be exalted to a greater degree of Perfection, then by all the <hi>Doctrine of Morality,</hi> which, indeed, is but a <hi>Sophist</hi> in compariſon of the other. Nay farther as <hi>Xenophon</hi> obſerved truly,<note place="margin">De Inſt. Cyri.</note> 
                  <hi>That all other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoe they raiſe the Mind, yet they diſtort and diſorder it by their extaſies and exceſſes; but only love doth at the ſame inſtant, dilate and compoſe the mind.</hi> So all other humane excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which we admire; thoe they advance nature, yet they
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:150781:243"/> are ſubject to <hi>exceſſe;</hi> only <hi>Charity</hi> admits no exceſſe. So we ſee the Angels while they aſpired to be like God in power, prevaricated and fell,<note place="margin">Eſa. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>I will aſcend above the altitude of the cloudes, I will be like the moſt high.</hi> So man, while he aſpired to be like God in Knowledge,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> digreſſed and fell. <hi>ye ſhall be like Gods knowing Good and Evill:</hi> but by aſpiring to a ſimilitude of Gods <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> neither Man nor Angell ever was endangered, nor ſhall be endangered. Nay we are invited to this imitation <hi>Bleſſe them that curſe you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and pray for them that deſpitefully uſe you and perſecute you; that you may be the ſonnes of your father which is in Heaven: for he makes his Sunne to riſe on the Evill and on the Good; and ſends Raine upon the juſt, and upon the unjuſt.</hi> So in the firſt Platforme of the Divine Nature, the Heathen Religion placeth Gods attributes thus, <hi>Optimus Maximus;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.</note> and ſacred Scripture ſpeaks thus, <hi>Miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia ejus, ſupra omnia opera ejus.</hi>

Catone.</note> for firſt, as <hi>Cato</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was wont to ſay of his Romans: <hi>That they were like Sheepe, a man were better drive a flock of them, then one of them; for in a Flock, if you could get but ſome few to goe right, you ſhall have all the rest follow of their own accord:</hi> So in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect indeed, the <hi>Dutie of Moralitie</hi> is ſomewhat more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult then that of Policy. <hi>Secondly Moralitie</hi> propounds to it ſelfe that the Minde be imbued and furniſht with <hi>Internal Goodneſſe;</hi> but <hi>Civile Knowledge</hi> requires no more, but <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe externall</hi> onely, for this as reſpecting ſociety, ſufficeth.
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:150781:245"/> Wherefore it often comes to paſſe that the Goverment is Good, the Times Bad: for in ſacred ſtory the ſaying is often repeated, ſpeaking of Good and Godly Kings, <hi>And yet the People directed not their hearts to the Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi> wherefore in this reſpect alſo the parts of Ethique are more auſtere and difficult. <hi>Thirdly, states</hi> have this nature, that like great Engines they are ſlowly moved, and not without great paines; whence it comes that they are not ſo eaſily put out of frame; <hi>For as in Aegipt</hi> the ſeven good yeares upheld the ſeven bad; ſo in States, the good gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Lawes of Precedent times cauſe that the errors of ſucceeding times, doe not ſo quickly ſupplant and ruine: but the Decrees and Cuſtomes of particular perſons, are more ſuddenly ſubverted. And this likewiſe doth charge Moralitie, but eaſeth Policy.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Civile Knowledge</hi> hath three parts, according to the three ſummarie Actions of Society; <hi>The Doctrine of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; the Doctrine of Negociation; and the Doctrine of Empire or Republiques.</hi> For there are three ſorts or Good, which men ſeek to procure to themſelves from civile Society; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort againſt ſolitude, Aſsiſtance in buiſneſſe; and Protection</hi> againſt Injuries: and theſe be three wiſdomes diſtinct one from the other, and often times disjoyn'd; <hi>Wiſdome in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; Wiſdome in Negotiation, &amp; Wiſdome in Gubernation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ <hi>As for Converſation,</hi> certainly it ought not to be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but much leſſe deſpiſed; ſeeing a wiſe moderation thereof, hath both an honour, and grace of Manners in it ſelfe; and a powerfull influence for the apt manage of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe; as well Publique, as Private. <hi>For as Action in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> is ſo much reſpected, (thoe it be but an outward quality) that it is preferr'd before thoſe other Parts which ſeeme more grave and intrinſeque; ſo <hi>Converſation</hi> &amp; the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, in a man or a Civile Practique life (however it conſiſteth in outward ceremonies) finds, if not the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, yet certainly a very eminent place. Of what ſpeciall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment the very <hi>Countenance</hi> is, and the compoſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Poet inſinuats where he ſaith,

               </p>
               <p>A man may cancell and utterly betray the force of his words, with his <hi>Countenance.</hi> Nay the <hi>Deeds</hi> as well as <hi>Words</hi> may likewiſe be deſtroyed by the <hi>Countenance,</hi> if we may believe <hi>Cicero,</hi> who when he would commend to his Brother <hi>Affabilitie</hi> towards the Provincials ſaid, that <hi>it</hi> did not chiefly conſiſt in this to give eaſie acceſſe unto his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſſe likewiſe he received them courteouſly even with his <hi>Countenance;</hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanity and outward Elegancy of Behaviour</hi> be intended too much, they paſſe into a deformed &amp; counterfeit <hi>Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Quid enim deformius quam ſcenam in vitam transferre.

And therefore as Tutors and Preceptors uſe to adviſe young Students in Univerſities, too much addicted to keep company; by ſaying, <hi>Amicos eſſe fures temporis:</hi> ſo certainly this ſame continuall intention of the minde upon the <hi>comelineſſe of Behaviour,</hi> is a great theefe

               <p>§ But before we deſcend to the Particular kinds, wee will ſpeak ſomething by way of Preface, in generall, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the <hi>The knowledge of Negociation. The knowledge of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation</hi> no man hath handled hetherto according to the dignity of the Subject; to the great derogation of Learning, &amp; the Profeſſors of Learning: for fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this root ſpringeth that note of <hi>Dullneſſe</hi> which hath defamed the Learned, which is; <hi>That there is no great concurrence betweene Learning and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctique wiſdome.</hi> For, if a man obſerve it well, of the three <hi>wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi> which we have ſet downe to pertaine to Civile life, that of <hi>Converſation</hi> is by learned men for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed as a ſervile thing and an enimie to Meditation. As for that <hi>wiſdome</hi> concerning <hi>Government,</hi> Learned men acquit themſelves well, when they are called to the manage of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Affaires in ſtate; but that is a Promotion which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to few. Concerning the WISDOME OF BUSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE (whereof we now ſpeak) wherein mans life is moſt converſant; there be no Books at all written of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:150781:247"/> a handfull of two of ſome few <hi>Civile Advertiſements,</hi> that have no proportion to the magnitude of this Subject. For if there were Books extant of this Argument, as of other, I doubt not, but Learned men with meane experience would farre excell men of long experience without Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and <hi>out-ſhoot them</hi> (as they ſay) <hi>in their own Bowe.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any cauſe why we ſhould feare leaſt the Matter of this <hi>Knowledge</hi> ſhould be ſo various, that it could not fall under Precepts, for it is much narrower than the <hi>Science of Government,</hi> which notwithſtanding we ſee is exactly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd, and ſubdued. Of this kinde of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> it ſeemes there have bin ſome Profeſſors amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi> in their beſt and wiſeſt times.<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> For <hi>Cicero</hi> reports that it was in uſe a litle before his time for Senators, that had the the name and opinion for wiſe and experienced men (the <hi>Coruncanii, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii, Laelii,</hi> and others) to walke at certaine houres in the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> where they might give acceſſe and audience to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and might be conſulted withall; not onely touching <hi>point of Law,</hi> but of al <hi>ſorts of Buſineſſe;</hi> as of the <hi>Marriage of a Daughter;</hi> or of <hi>the bringing up of a Sonne; or of a Purchaſe, of a Bargaine, of an Accuſation, Defence;</hi> and every other occaſion incident to mans life. By this it plainly appeares, that there is <hi>a Wiſdome of giving Counſil and Adviſe</hi> even in Private Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; ariſing out of an univerſall in ſight into the Affaires of the World; which is uſed indeed upon particular Cauſes, but is gathered by generall obſervation of Cauſes of like nature. For ſo we ſee in the Book which <hi>Q. Cicero</hi> writeth unto his Brother, <hi>De Petitione Conſulatus</hi> (being the onely Booke of Particular Buſineſſe,<note place="margin">Q. Cicero de Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Conſul.</note> that I know written by the Ancients) althoe it concerned ſpecially an Action then on foot, yet it containes in it many Politique Axiomes, which preſcribe not only temporarie uſe, but a perpetual direction in the caſe of Popular Elections. <hi>And in this kinde</hi> nothing is extant which may any way be compar'd with thoſe Aphoriſmes which <hi>Solomon the King</hi> ſet forth, of whom the Scriptures teſtifie, <hi>That his Heart was as the Sands of the Sea:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Reg. IV.</note> For as the Sands of the Sea do incompaſſe al the utmoſt bounds of the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:150781:248"/> world; ſo his wiſedome comprehended all matters, as well humane, as divine. In theſe <hi>Aphoriſmes</hi> you ſhall cleerely diſcover, beſide thoſe precepts which are more divine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny moſt excellent Civile precepts and advertiſements, ſpringing out of the profound ſecrets of <hi>wiſdome,</hi> and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over into a large field of variety. Now becauſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as DEFICIENT, <hi>the Doctrine touching diſperſed occaſions,</hi> (which is a firſt portion of <hi>the knowledge of Buſineſſe</hi>) we will, after our manner, ſtay a while upon it, and propound an example thereof, taken out of thoſe <hi>Aphoriſmes,</hi> or <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Neither is there in our judgement, any cauſe of juſt reprehenſion, for that we draw from writers of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, ſomething to a politicall ſenſe; for I am ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily of opinion, that if thoſe <hi>Commentaries of the ſame Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon were now extant concerning Nature</hi> (wherein he hath written of all <hi>Vegetables,</hi>

Wherefore it is ever the beſt courſe to ſay ſomething inſtantly in your own defence, according as the occaſion of the preſent buſineſſe ſhall adminiſter. <hi>Thirdly that by all means, an anſwere be made;</hi> an anſwere (I ſay) not a meere confeſsion or a meere ſubmiſsion, but yet not without ſome ſprinklings of an Apology and excuſe let fall here and there; nor is it ſafe to beare your ſelfe otherwiſe, unleſſe you have to deale with very generous and noble diſpoſitions; which are very rare. <hi>It followes in the ſecond place,</hi> that the anſwere made, be ſoft and temperate; and not harſh and peremptory.</p>

                        <p>THe Parable gives in Precept, how a man ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane himſelfe, having incurr'd the wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Prince. The Precept hath two bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Firſt <hi>that he relinquiſh not his place;</hi> Secondly, <hi>that with caution and diligence he attend the Cure, as in caſe of ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous diſeaſe.</hi> For men are wont after they perceive their Princes diſpleaſure againſt them, to retire themſelves from the execution of their charge and office; <hi>partly</hi> put of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience of diſgrace; <hi>partly</hi> leſt they ſhould revive the wound by beeing in the Preſence; <hi>partly</hi> that Princes may ſee their ſorrow and humility; <hi>nay ſometimes</hi> to reſigne up the Places and Dignities they held, into the hands of the Prince. But <hi>Solomon</hi> cenſures this way of <hi>Cure,</hi> as prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and hurtfull; and that upon a very good ground. <hi>For firſt this courſe doth too much noiſe abroad the diſgrace it ſelfe;</hi> ſo as enimies and enviers become more confident to hurt, and friends more fearfull to help him. <hi>Secondly it comes to paſſe that the wrath of the Prince,</hi> which perchance if it had not bin publiſht, would have died of it ſelfe, is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fixt; and having once made way to his ruine, is carried on to his utter ſubverſion. <hi>Lastly, this retiring taſts ſomewhat of a malignant humor, and of one fallen out with the times; which cumulates the evill of Jndignation, to the evill of
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:150781:255"/> ſuſpicion.</hi> Now the precepts for cure are theſe. <hi>Firſt, above all things let him take heed that he ſeem not inſenſible, or not ſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, as in duty he ought to be, for the Princes diſpleaſure, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a stupidity or ſtubbornneſse of mind:</hi> that is, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his countenance, not to a ſullen and contumacious ſadneſſe; but to a grave and modeſt penſiveneſſe; and in all matters of imployment, that he ſhew himſelfe leſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and cheerefull then he was wont to be; and it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his caſe to uſe the aſsiſtance and mediation of ſome friend, unto the Prince, which may ſeaſonably inſinuate, with what feeling griefe he is inwardly afflicted. <hi>Secondly let him carefully avoide all, even the leaſt occaſions whereby the matter that gave the first cauſe to the indignation, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd;</hi> or the Prince take occaſion to be againe diſpleaſed with him, or to rebuke him for any thing, before others. <hi>Thirdly, let him with all diligence ſeeke out all occaſions wherein his ſervice may be acceptable to his Prince;</hi> that he may ſhew both a prompt affection to redime his fore-paſt offence; and <hi>that his Prince may</hi> underſtand what a good ſervant he may chance to be deprived of, if he thus caſt him off. <hi>Fourthly, that by a wiſe art of Policy, he either lay the fault it ſelfe upon others; or inſinuate, that it was committed with no ill intention; or make remonſtrance of their Malice, who accuſed him to the King,</hi> and aggravated the matter above demerit. <hi>Laſt of all, let him be every way circumſpect and intent upon the Cure.</hi>

                     <hi>I will doe this alſo and yet goe on in my courſe.</hi> So a <hi>Politique</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular occurrence ſhould make this account, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution with himſelfe; <hi>And J will doe this likewiſe and yet learne ſomething that may be of uſe hereafter.</hi> And therefore they who are of ſuch a heavy wit and narrow comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as to overdoe one particular, and are wholly taken up with the buſineſſe in hand;<note place="margin">Eſſayes.</note> and doe not ſo much as thinke of any matters which intervene (a weakneſſe that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne</hi> confeſſes in himſelfe) ſuch indeed are the beſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Princes and of ſtate; but faile in point of their own <hi>Fortune.</hi> But in the meane, above all things caution muſt be taken, <hi>that we have a good ſtay and hold of our ſelves, by repreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a too active forwardneſſe of diſpoſition;</hi> leaſt that this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much, doe not draw us on to much medling; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more unfortunate, than light and raſh intermedling in many matters. So that this <hi>variety of knowledge of Perſons and Actions,</hi> which we give in precept to be procured, tends in concluſion to this; to make a judicious choice both of thoſe <hi>Actions</hi> we undertake, and of thoſe <hi>Perſons</hi> whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and aſsiſtance we uſe, that ſo we may know how to conduct our affaires with more dexterity and ſafety.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>After the knowledge of others</hi> followes the <hi>knowledge of our ſelves;</hi> for no leſſe diligence, rather more is to be taken in a true and exact underſtanding of <hi>our own Perſons; than of the Perſons of others;</hi> for the Oracle, <hi>Noſce Teipſum,</hi> is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a rule of univerſall Prudence,<note place="margin">Iacob.

                     <hi>Iames</hi> excellently puts us in minde, <hi>that he that viewes his Face in a Glaſſe, yet instantly forgets what a one he was;</hi> ſo that there is need of a very frequent inſpection. The ſame holds alſo in Civile Affaires; but there are indeed divers <hi>Glaſſes;</hi> for the <hi>Divine Glaſſe</hi> in which we muſt look our ſelves, is the word of God; but the <hi>Politique Glaſſe</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the ſtate of the world and times wherein we live. <hi>Wherefore</hi> a man ought to take an exact examination, and an impartiall view (not ſuch as uſeth to be taken by one too much in love with himſelfe) of his own abilities, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:150781:267"/> and ſuports; as likewiſe of his own defects, Inhabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and Impediments; ſo making his accounts, that he ever eſtimate <hi>theſe</hi> with the moſt, <hi>thoſe</hi> rather with the leaſt; and from this view and examination theſe points following come into conſideration.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>The firſt Conſideration ſhould be, how a mans individuall conſtitution and morall temper ſorts with the generall ſtate of the times; which if they be found agreeable, then he may give himſelf more ſcope and liberty and uſe his own nature; but if there be any antipathy and diſſonancy then in the whole courſe of his life hee ſhould carry himſelfe more cloſe retired, and reſerved.</hi> So did <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> who being conſcient of his own temper not well ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with his times was never ſeene at publique Plaies, and came not into the Senate in twelve of his laſt yeares: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary <hi>Auguſtus</hi> lived ever in mens eyes, which alſo <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves:<note place="margin">Annal. I.</note> 
                     <hi>Alia Tiberio Morum via;</hi> the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon too was to ſecure his perſon from danger.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>The ſecond Conſideration ſhould be how a mans nature ſorts with the Profeſsions and courſes of life which are in uſe &amp; eſtime, and whereof he is to make his choice, that ſo if he have not yet deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined what race to run, or what courſe of life to take, he may chuſe that which is moſt fit and agreeable to his naturall diſpoſition; but if he be engaged already in a condition of life, to which by nature he is not ſo fitted, let him make a departure at the firſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and take another Profeſsion.</hi> This we ſee was done by <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine Borgia</hi> that was deſign'd by his father to a Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall profeſsion, which, obeying the bent of his own nature, he quitted ſoone after, and applied himſelfe to a Military courſe of life; tho as equally unworthy the dignity of a Prince as of a Prieſt, ſeeing the peſtilent Man hath diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured both.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>The third Conſideration ſhould be how a man may bee va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and may deport himſelfe as he is compar'd with his equals &amp; Rivals, whom it is likely he may have competitors and Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in his Fortune, and that he take that courſe of life wherein there is the greateſt ſolitude of able men; and himſelfe like to be moſt eminent.</hi> Thus <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> did, who at firſt was an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:150781:267"/> or Pleader, and was chiefe converſant in the gowne-Arts of Peace; but when he ſaw <hi>Cicero, Hortenſius,</hi> and <hi>Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> to excell in the glory of Eloquence, and no man eminent for the warres but <hi>Pompeius,</hi> he forſook his courſe and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a long fare-well to a Civile and Popular Greatneſſe, transferd his deſignes to the warres and to a Martiall Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; by which mean he aſcended to the top of ſoveraignty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth Conſideration may be, that in the choice of friends and inward dependances, a man conſult his own nature and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and proceed according to the compoſition of his own temper; for different conſtitutions require different kinds of friends to complie withall; to ſome men, ſolemne and ſilent natures, to others bold and boasting humours are acceptable; and many of like ſort.</hi> Certainly it is worth the obſervation, to ſee of what diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition the friends and followers of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> were, (as <hi>Antonius, Hirtius, Panſa, Oppius, Balbus, Dolabella, Pollio,</hi> the reſt,) theſe were wont to ſweare <hi>ità vivente Caeſare moriar;</hi> bearing an infinite affection to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but towards all others diſdainefull and arrogant, and they were men in publique Buſineſſe active and effectuall; in fame and reputation not ſo ſolemne and celebrated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifth Conſideration may be that a man take heed how hee guide himſelfe by Examples, and that he doe not fondly affect the Imitation of others; as if that which is pervious to others, must needs be as patent to him, never conſidering with himſelfe what difference perhaps there is betwixt his and their natures and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, whom he hath choſen for his pattern and example.</hi> This was manifeſtly <hi>Pompeius</hi> error, who, as <hi>Cicero</hi> reports it, was wont often to ſay <hi>Sylla potuit, Ego non potero?</hi> wherein hee was much abuſed, the nature and proceedings of himſelfe, and <hi>Sylla</hi> being the unlikelieſt in the world; the one being fierce, violent, and preſsing the fact; the other ſolemne, reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing Lawes, directing all to Majeſtie and Fame; and therefore the leſſe effectuall and powerfull to goe thorough with his deſignes. There are more Precepts of this nature, but theſe ſhall ſuffice for example to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>Nor is the well understanding, and diſcerning of a mans
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150781:268"/> ſelfe ſufficient, but he must conſult with himſelfe upon a way how he may aptly and wiſely open and reveale himſelfe, and in ſumme become flexible and moulded to the ſeverall formes &amp; impreſsions of occaſions.</hi> As for the <hi>Revealing of a mans ſelfe,</hi> we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more uſuall, than for the leſſe able man to make the greater ſhew. Wherefore it is a great advantage to good parts, if a man can by a kinde of Art and Grace <hi>ſet forth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to others,</hi> by aptly <hi>revealing</hi> (ſo it be done without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſt or arrogance) his virtues, Merits, and Fortune; and on the contrary by covering artificially his weakneſſes, defects, misfortunes and diſgraces; ſtaying upon thoſe, &amp; as it were, turning them to the light; ſliding from theſe and leſſening them by an apt expoſition, and the like. <hi>Wherefore Tacitus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Mucianus,</hi> who was the wiſeſt man and the greateſt Politique of his time,<note place="margin">Hiſt. alicubi.</note>

This ſetting forth of a mans ſelfe</hi> requires indeed ſome Art, leaſt it turne tedious and arrogant; but yet ſo, as ſome kinde of <hi>Oſtentation,</hi> tho it be to the firſt degree of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſeems rather a vice in the <hi>Ethiques,</hi> than in the <hi>Politiques.</hi> For as it is uſually ſaid of <hi>Slander, Audacter calumniare, ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aliquid haeret.</hi> So it may be ſaid of <hi>Oſtentation</hi> (unleſſe it be in a groſſe manner deform'd and ridiculous) <hi>Audacter te vendita, ſemper aliquid haeret;</hi> it will ſtick certainly with the more ignorant and inferiour ſort of men, tho the more wiſe and ſolemne ſmile at it, and deſpiſe it. <hi>Wherefore the Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wonne with many, ſhall countervaile the Diſdaine of a few.</hi> But if this <hi>Ostentation of a mans ſelfe,</hi> whereof we ſpeak be carried with decency and diſcretion; for example, if it make ſhew of a native candor and imbred ingenuity; or if it be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd at times, when other Perils approach (as in Military perſons in time of warre;) or at times when others are moſt envied; or if words which reſpect a mans <hi>own Praiſe,</hi> ſeem to fall from him in a careleſſe paſſage, as intending ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, without dwelling too long upon them, or being too ſerious; or if a man ſo <hi>grace himſelfe,</hi> as with equall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he forbeares not to tax &amp; jeſt at himſelfe; or in ſumme, if he doe this not of his own accord, but as urg'd &amp; provokt
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:150781:268"/> by the inſolencies and contumelies of others; it doth great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adde to a mans Reputation. <hi>And ſurely</hi> not a few more ſolid than windy natures, (and therefore want the Art of bearing up ſayle in the heighth of the winds;) ſuffer for their moderation, not without ſome prejudice, and diſadvantage to their reputation and merit. <hi>But for theſe</hi> Flouriſhes and enhancements of virtue, however ſome of weake judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and perchance too ſeverely Morall, may diſallow, no man will deny this, but that we ſhould endeavour at leaſt, that virtue thorow careleſſe negligence be not diſvalewed, and imbaſed under the juſt price. <hi>This diminution</hi> of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lew, and abating the price in eſtimating Virtue, is wont to fall out three waies. <hi>Firſt when</hi> a man offers and obtrudes himſelfe and ſervice in matters of imployment not call'd nor ſent for; ſuch prompt offices as theſe are reputed well rewarded, if they be not refuſed. <hi>Secondly when</hi> a man in the beginning and firſt on-ſet of an imployment, too much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſeth his own forces &amp; abilities, when that which ſhould have bin performed by degrees, he laviſheth out all at once; which in matters well managed, winnes early grace and commendation, but in the end induceth ſatietie. <hi>Thirdly when</hi> a man is too ſodainly ſenſible, and too inconſiderately tranſported with the fruit of his virtue, in commendation, applauſe, honour, favour conferr'd upon him; and is too much affected and delighted therewith: of this point there is a wiſe Aviſo: <hi>Beware leaſt you ſeeme unacquainted with great matters, that are thus pleas'd with ſmall, as if they were great.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ <hi>But the covering of Defects is of no leſſe importance, than a wiſe and dexterous ostentation of virtues. Defects are conceal'd and ſecreted by a threefold induſtry, and as it were under three coverts, Caution, Colour, and Confidence. Caution</hi> is that, when we doe wiſely avoid to be put upon thoſe things for which we are not proper; whereas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe bold &amp; undertaking ſpirits will eaſily engage themſelves without judgement, in matters wherein they are not ſeen, and ſo publiſh and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all their imperfections. <hi>Colour</hi> is when we doe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and wiſely prepare and make way, to have a favourable
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:150781:269"/> and commodious conſtruction made of our faults and wants; as proceeding from a better cauſe, or intended for ſome other purpoſe than is generally conceiv'd: for of the Coverts of Faults the Poet ſaith well,
<q>
                        <note place="margin">Ovid.</note>Saepe latet vitium proximitate Boni.</q> Wherefore if we perceive a <hi>Defect</hi> in our ſelves, our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour muſt be to borrow and put on the <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Colour</hi> of the next bordering Virtue wherewith it may be ſhadowed and ſecreted. For inſtance, he that is <hi>Dull,</hi> muſt pretend <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;</hi> he that is a <hi>Coward, mildneſſe,</hi> and ſo the reſt. And it will advantage, to frame ſome probable cauſe, and to give it out and ſpread it abroad, that induced us to diſſemble our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and not doe our beſt; that ſo <hi>making a Virtue of Neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> what was not in our <hi>power,</hi> may ſeem not to have bin in our <hi>will</hi> to doe. <hi>As for Confidence,</hi> it is indeed an impudent, but the ſureſt and moſt effectuall remedy; namely that a man profeſſe himſelfe to deſpiſe and ſet at naught, what in truth he cannot attaine; according to the Principle of wiſe Merchants, with whom it is familiar to raiſe the price of their own Commodities, and to beat downe the price of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>But there</hi> is another kinde of <hi>Confidence</hi> farre more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent than this, which is to <hi>face out a mans own Defects,</hi> —to boaſt them and obtrude them upon Opinion; as if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd that he was beſt in thoſe things, wherein hee moſt fayles; and to help that againe, that the Deception put upon others may come off more roundly, he may faine, that he hath leaſt opinion of himſelfe in thoſe things, wherein he is beſt. <hi>Like</hi> as we ſee it commonly in Poets; for a Poet reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his verſes, if you except againſt any verſe, you ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently heare him reply, <hi>And for this verſe it coſt me more labour than the reſt;</hi> and than he will bring you ſome other verſe, &amp; ſeem to diſable and ſuſpect that rather, and aske your judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, which yet he knowes to be the beſt in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and not liable to exception. <hi>But above</hi> all, in this <hi>Helping a mans ſelfe in his carriage,</hi> namely, that a man may ſet the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt gloſſe upon himſelfe before others, and right himſelfe in all points, nothing, in my opinion, availes more, <hi>than that
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:150781:269"/> a man doe not diſmantle himſelfe and expoſe his perſon to ſcorne and injurie by his too much Goodneſſe and Facility of Nature; but rather in all things ſhew ſome ſparkles and edge of a free and generous ſpirit, that carries with it as well a ſting, as Hony.</hi> Which kinde of fortified carriage togither with a prompt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared reſolution to vindicate a mans ſelfe from ſcorne, is impoſed upon ſome by accident and a kinde of an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſsity, for ſomewhat inherent in their perſon or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as we ſee it in Deformed Perſons and Baſtards, and in Perſons any way diſgrac'd; ſo that ſuch natures, if they have any good parts commonly they ſucceed with good felicity.</p>

But from what root or cauſe ſoever this viſcoſity and reſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind proceeds, it is a thing moſt prejudicial both to a mans affaires and fortunes; <hi>and nothing is more politique, than to make the wheele of our mind concentrique and voluble with the wheeles of Fortune.</hi> Thus much of the two ſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precepts touching the <hi>Architecture of Fortune. Precepts
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:150781:271"/> Scatterd</hi> are many, but we will only ſelect a few to ſerve as examples to the reſt.</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>The firſt Precept</hi> is, that this <hi>Architect of his own fortune rightly uſe his Rule, that is, that he inure his minde to judge of the Proportion and valure of things, as they conduce more or leſſe to his own fortune and ends; and that he intend the ſame ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and not ſuperficially.</hi> For it is ſtrange but moſt true, that there are many, whoſe <hi>Logicall part of Minde</hi> (if I may ſo terme it) is good, but the <hi>Mathematical part</hi> nothing worth; that is, who can well and ſoundly judge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, but very unskilfully of the prizes of things. Hence it comes to paſſe, that ſome fall in love and into ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration with the private and ſecret acceſſe to Princes; <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> with popular fame and applauſe, ſuppoſing they are things of great purchaſe, when in many caſes they are but matters of envy, perill, and impediment: <hi>others</hi> meaſure things, according to the labour and difficulty ſpent about them, thinking that if they be ever moveing, they muſt needs advance and proceed; as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid in a deſpiſeing manner of <hi>Cato <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis,</hi> when he deſcribes how labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, aſsiduous and indefatigable he was to no great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>Omnia</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>magno studio agebat. Hence</hi> likewiſe it comes to paſſe, that men often abuſe themſelves, who if they uſe the favour and furtherance of ſome great and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſon, they promiſe themſelves all proſperous ſucceſſe; whereas the truth is, that, not the greateſt, but the apteſt inſtruments, ſooneſt, and more happily accompliſh a worke. <hi>And for</hi> the true direction of the <hi>Mathematicall ſquare of the Mind;</hi> it is worth the paines eſpecially to know, and have it ſet downe, what ought <hi>firſt</hi> to be reſolved upon for the <hi>building and advanceing of a mans fortune?</hi> what <hi>next,</hi> and ſo forward?</p>
                  <p>§ <hi>In the first place I ſet downe, the Amendment of the mind;</hi> for by taking away and ſmoothing the impediments, and rubbes of the Minde, you ſhall ſooner open a way to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, than by the aſsiſtance of Fortune, take away the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments of the Mind. <hi>In the ſecond place I ſet downe wealth and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:150781:271"/> Means,</hi> which perchance moſt men would have placed firſt, becauſe of the generall uſe it bears towards all variety of occaſions;<note place="margin">Diſcorsſi in T. Livio lib. 2.</note> but that opinion I may condemne with like reaſon, as <hi>Machiavell</hi> in another caſe not much unlike; for whereas the old ſaying was, that <hi>Monies were the ſinewes of warre,</hi> he on the contrary affirmed, <hi>that there were no other ſinewes of warres, ſave the ſinewes of valiant mens armes.</hi> In like manner it may be truly affirmed, <hi>that it is not Monies that is the ſinewes of Fortune,</hi> but the ſinewes rather and abilities of the Mind, Wit, Courage, Audacity, Reſolution, Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Induſtry, and the like. <hi>In the third place, I ſet downe Fame and Reputation,</hi> and the rather becauſe they have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tides and times, which if you doe not take in their due ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are ſeldome recovered, <hi>it being a very hard matter to play an after game of Reputation. Jn the laſt place I ſet downe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> to which certainly there is a more eaſy acceſſe made by any of the other three, much more by all united; than if you begin with <hi>Honours</hi> and ſo proceed to the reſt. But as it is of ſpeciall conſequence, to obſerve the order and priority of <hi>things;</hi> ſo is it of litle leſſe import, to obſerve the order and priority of <hi>Time;</hi> the prepoſterous placing whereof, is one of the communeſt errors; while men flye unto their ends, when they ſhould intend their beginings; and whilſt we ſodainly ceize upon the higheſt matters, we raſhly paſſe over what lies in the midſt; but it is a good precept, <hi>Quod nunc inſtat agamus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond Precept is, that upon a greatneſſe and Confidence of Mind, we doe not engage our forces in too arduous matters, which we cannot ſo well conquer; nor that we rowe againſt the ſtream.</hi> For as touching mens Fortune, the counſil is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
<q>— Fatis accede Deiſque.</q> Let us looke about us on every ſide, and obſerve where things are open, where ſhut and obſtructed; where eaſy, where difficile, to be compaſſed; and that we doe not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine and miſemploy our ſtrength where the way is not paſſable, for this will preſerve us from foile; not occupy us too much about one matter; we ſhall win an opinion of
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:150781:272"/> Moderation; offend few; and laſtly, make a ſhew of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall felicity in all we undertake; whileſt thoſe things which peradventure would of their own accord have come to paſſe, ſhall be attributed to their providence &amp; induſtrie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third Precept</hi> may ſeeme to have ſome repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with that former immediatly going before; though it be well underſtood, there is none at all. <hi>The Precept is this; that we doe not alwaies expect occaſions, but ſometimes provoke them, and lead the way unto them;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Orat. in Phil. I.</note> which is that which <hi>Demosthenes</hi> intimates in high termes. <hi>For as it is a received principle that a Generall ſhould lead the Armie; ſo wiſe and underſtanding men ſhould conduct and command matters, and ſuch things ſhould bee done as they ſaw fit to be done; and that they ſhould not be forc'd to purſue and build only upon events.</hi> For if we diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it we ſhall obſerve <hi>two</hi> differing kindes of ſufficiency in managing affaires and handling buſineſſe; for ſome can make uſe of occaſions aptly and dexterouſly, but plot and excogitate nothing; ſome are all for Plots, which they can well urge and purſue, but cannot accommodate &amp; take in: Either of which abilities is maimed, and imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A fourth Precept is, not to imbrace any matters which doe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie too great a quantitie of time; but to have that verſe ever ſounding in our eares.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sed fugit interea fugit irreparabile tempus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the cauſe why thoſe who addict themſelves to profeſsions of burden and the like, as Lawyers, Orators, painfull Divines, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Books, and the like, are not commonly ſo politique in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving and promoting their own fortunes, is no other then this; that they want time which is otherwiſe imployed, to informe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Particulars; and to wait upon occaſions, and to deviſe &amp; project deſignes which may conduce to the making of their fortune.</hi> Nay further, in the Courts of Princes and in ſtates, you ſhall have thoſe that are exceeding powerfull and expert how to advance their own Fortune, and to invade the Fortune of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which undergoe no publique charge, but are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practized in that whereof we ſpeake, <hi>The Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:150781:272"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Fifth Precept is, to imitate nature which doth nothing in vaine.</hi> Which certainly we may doe, if we diſcreetly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and interlace our buſineſſes of all ſorts. For the minde ſhould in every particular action be ſo diſpoſed and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and our intentions ſo ſubdued, and ſubordinated one under another; as if we can not have that we ſeek in the beſt degree, yet we may have it in a ſecond, or at leaſt in a third: but if we can get no footing nor any conſiſtency at all in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of a thing we deſire; than we may turne the paines we have taken upon ſome other end, then that whereto it was deſigned: but if we cannot make any thing of it for the preſent, at leaſt we may extract ſomething out of it that may ſtand us inſtead for the time to come; but if we can derive no ſolid effect or ſubſtance from it, neither for the preſent nor for the future; let us yet endeavour to winne ſome good opinion and reputation by it; and the like: ever exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accoumpts of our ſelves, whereby it may appeare that we have reapt ſomewhat more or leſſe from every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Action and Counſil; never ſuffering our ſelves to bee caſt down and diſpirited, like men amaz'd and confuſed, if perchance we faile in the principal ſcope of our intentions. For nothing is more prejudicious to a Politique, than to be wholly and ſolely taken up with one thing; for he that doth ſo, looſeth infinite occaſions which doe intervene upon the by; and which perhaps are more proper and propitious for ſomewhat that may be of uſe hereafter; than for thoſe things we urge for the preſent: and therefore we muſt be perfect in that Rule, <hi>Haec oportet facere &amp; illa non omittere.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſixth Precept is, that we engage not our ſelves too peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily in any thing though it ſeeme not at firſt ſight, liable to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but that we ever have either an open window to fly out at, or a ſecret posterne way to retire by.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſeaventh Precept is,</hi> that ancient Rule of Bias; ſo it be conſtrued not to any point of Perfidiouſneſſe; but to cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and moderation. <hi>So loue a man as yet thou maiſt become an enimie, ſo hate a man as yet thou mayſt become his Friend;</hi> for it utterly betrayes and fruſtrates all utility, for a man to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:150781:273"/> himſelfe too farre in unfortunate friendſhips; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and troubleſome ſpleenes, or childiſh and humorous Aemulations.</p>

                     <hi>Theſe ſhall</hi> ſuffice for examples touching the knowledge <hi>of the Advancement of Life:</hi> yet I would have it remembred, that theſe adumbrations which we have drawne and ſet downe as <hi>Deficients,</hi> are farre from compleat Tractates of them, but only that they are as litle peeces and edgings for patternes, whereby a judgement may be made of the whole web. Againe we are not ſo weake and fooliſh as to avouch that <hi>Fortunes</hi> are not to be obtained without all this adoe; for we know well they come tumbling into ſome mens laps, and a numbre obtaine good <hi>fortunes</hi> onely with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and aſsiduity (with ſome litle caution intermingled) in a plaine way, without any great or painfull Art. But as <hi>Cicero</hi> when he ſets down the Idea of a perfect Orator, doth not mean that every Pleader ſhould be or can be ſuch: and againe as in the deſcription of a Prince or a Courtier, by ſuch as have handled thoſe ſubjects; the Mould is made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the perfection of the Art, and not according to common practice: the ſame vve have performed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a <hi>Politique</hi> man; J mean <hi>Politique for his owne Fortune.</hi> And likewiſe take this advertiſement along vvith you. That the Precepts vvhich vve have choſen &amp; ſet down, are all of that kinde vvhich may be counted and called <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Artes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Libro del Pren.</note> As for <hi>Evill Arts,</hi> if a man vvould yeeld himſelfe a diſciple to Machiavell vvho gives it in precept, <hi>That a man needs not much care for virtue it ſelfe, but for the appearance on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereof in the eyes of the world, becauſe the fame and credit of virtue is a help, but the uſe of it a cumber;</hi> vvho in another place gives this rule: That a Politique man lay this as a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Practique wiſdome, <hi>that he preſuppoſe, that men are not rightly &amp; ſafely to be wrought upon &amp; bowed to the bent of our wils, otherwiſe than by feare; &amp; therefore let him endeavour by all meanes poſsible to have every man obnoxious, low &amp; in ſtreights.</hi> So as Machiavells Politician ſeems to be vvhat the Italians call <hi>jl ſeminatore délle ſpine;</hi> or if any vvould imbrace that
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:150781:273"/> Principle vvhich <hi>Cicero</hi> cites, <hi>Cadant amici, dummodo inimici intercidant;</hi> as the <hi>Trium viri</hi> ſold the lives of their friends, for the deaths of their enimies. Or if a man would be an imitator of <hi>L.

                     <note place="margin">Plutar. in Lyſand.</note> who was wont to ſay, <hi>That children are to be deceived with Comfits, and men with Othes.</hi> With other ſuch corrupt and pernitious Poſitions of the ſame impreſsion, whereof (as in all other things, there are more in number, than of the good &amp; ſound.

Never any State was in this point ſo open to receive ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into their Body, as were the Romanes; therefore their Fortune ſeconded their wiſe inſtitution, for they grew to the greateſt Monarchy in the world. Their manner was to grant <hi>Naturalization</hi> (which they called <hi>Ius Civitatis</hi>) and to grant it in the higheſt degree; that is,<note place="margin">Exempla apud Cic. pro L. C.

And beſides, thoe the Spaniards have not had that uſeage to <hi>Naturalize</hi> liberaly; yet they have that which is next to it, that is, <hi>To imploy, almoſt indifferently, all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their Militia of Ordinary ſouldiers,</hi> yea and ſometimes they conferre their higheſt commands of warre, upon Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:150781:278"/> that are no naturall Spaniards: nay it ſeemes, not long agoe, they have begun to grow ſenſible of this want of Natives, and to ſeek a Remedy, as appears by the <hi>Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Sanction</hi> publiſht this yeare.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Jt is moſt Certaine that ſedentary and within-doore Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall Arts; and Delicate Manufactures</hi> (that require rather the Finger, than the Arme,) <hi>have in their nature a contrariety to a Military Diſpoſition.</hi> And generally all warlike People are a litle idle; and love danger better than travaile: neither muſt they be too much broken of it, if we will have their ſpirits preſerv'd in vigor. Therefore it was great advantage in the ancient ſtates of <hi>Sparta, Athens, Rome,</hi> and others, that they had the uſe, not of <hi>Free-men,</hi> but of <hi>Slaves,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly did rid thoſe <hi>Manufactures:</hi> but the uſe of <hi>Slaves</hi> ſince the receiving of the <hi>Chriſtian Law,</hi> is, in greateſt part aboliſht.

               <p>§ <hi>As for Illations</hi> we ought to know that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us a <hi>uſe of Reaſon</hi> and Argument, in regard of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,</hi> ſecondary and Reſpective; not Primitive and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute: for after the <hi>Articles and Principles of Religion,</hi> are placed in their ſeats, ſo as they ſtand altogether exempt from the examination of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it is then indeed permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto us to make derivations &amp; inferences from them, according to the Analogie of them. <hi>Jn things Natural</hi> this holds not; for both the Principles are liable to examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by <hi>Jnduction</hi> I mean, thoe not by <hi>Syllogiſme;</hi> and the ſame Principles have no repugnancy with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but that the firſt and midle Propoſitions, may be derived from the ſame fountaine. But it is otherwiſe in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> where the firſt propoſitions are their own ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſubſiſtent by themſelves; and again, they are not regulate by that <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which inferreth conſequent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. Nor holdeth this in <hi>Religion</hi> alone, but alſo in other <hi>Sciences</hi> both of greater and ſmaller nature; namely <hi>Where the Primarie Propoſitions are Placita not Poſita;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in <hi>theſe</hi> alſo the <hi>uſe of Reaſon</hi> cannot be abſolute. <hi>For inſtance we ſee in Games, as Cheſſe, or the like, that the firſt Draughts and Lawes of the Play are meerely poſitive &amp; ad pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum, which muſt abſolutely be accepted and not diſputed; but that thereupon you may win the Game, and with the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:150781:299"/> manage your play, is a thing artificial and Rational.</hi> So it is likewiſe in Humane Lawes, wherein there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Maximes</hi> (as they ſtile them) that is, meere <hi>Placita Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> grounded more <hi>upon Authority than Reaſon;</hi> neither come they into diſceptation: but what is <hi>most juſt,</hi> not abſolutely but relatively, (that is from the Analogie of <hi>theſe maximes</hi>) that indeed is <hi>Rational,</hi> and affords a large field of Diſputation. Such therefore is that <hi>ſecondary Reaſon,</hi> which hath place in <hi>ſacred Theologie</hi> that is, which is grounded upon the <hi>Placits of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ And as there is a double <hi>uſe of humane Reaſon in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Divine;</hi> ſo in the ſame uſe there is a double exceſſe; the one <hi>where there is made a more curious enquiry into the manner of the Myſtery, than is beſeeming;</hi> the other <hi>when equall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is attributed to Derivations, which is to Principles.</hi> For both he, may ſeem to be <hi>Nicodemus Diſciple,</hi> who perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly enquires <hi>How can a man be borne when he is old?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. III.</note> and he in no wiſe can be accounted <hi>Pauls Diſciple,</hi> which may not ſometimes interlace his inſtructions with <hi>Ego non Dominus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">I. Cor. VII.</note> or that, <hi>According to my Iudgement;</hi> for to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Illations</hi> that ſtile is well applied: wherefore to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding it would be a wholſome and very profitable courſe, if there were a ſober and diligent Tractate compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which as a kind of <hi>Divine Dialectique</hi> might give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, <hi>concerning the true limits and uſe of Reaſon in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Divine;</hi> which would be a kind of <hi>Opiate Medicine, not only to quiet and lay aſleepe the vanity of Aery ſpeculations, wherewith the Schooles ſometime labour; but likewiſe not a litle calme and mitigate the furies and rage of Controverſies, which raiſe ſideings and factions in the Church.</hi> A Treatiſe of this nature we ſet downe as <hi>Deficient,</hi> and terme it SOPHRON or <hi>the right uſe of Humane Reaſon in matters Divine.</hi>

               <p n="2">II It imports exceedingly the <hi>Peace of the Church,</hi> that the <hi>League of Chriſtians,</hi> preſcribed by our Saviour in thoſe two clauſes which ſeem to croſſe one the other, were well and clearely expounded; whereof the one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines thus, <hi>He that is not with us is againſt us,</hi> the other thus,

                  <hi>one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme;</hi> and not, <hi>one Rite, one Opinion.</hi> We ſee likewiſe the Coat of our Saviour <hi>was entire without ſeame;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. XIX.</note> but the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church <hi>was of divers Colours.</hi>

When Moſes ſaw an Egyptian fighting with an Iſraelite, he did not ſay, why ſtrive you? but drew his ſword and ſlew the Egyptian; but when he ſaw two Iſraelites fight, though it could not poſsible be that both parties had a juſt cauſe; yet he thus beſpeaks them both,<note place="margin">Exod.

And if any think that this hath bin done now long agoe, let him ſeriouſly conſider with what ſyncerity, and moderation the ſame hath bin perform'd.

               </p>
               <p n="3">III Seeing the Parts of ſacred Scripture touching the <hi>Information of Theology,</hi> are ſuch and ſo great; let us ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſider the Interpretation thereof; nor doe we here ſpeak of the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>interpretateing them,</hi> which is
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:150781:300"/> eſtabliſht by the conſent of the Church, but of the <hi>manner of Interpreting.</hi> This is of two ſorts, <hi>Methodicall;</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> or at large: for this divine water, which infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells that of <hi>Iacobs well,</hi> is drawn forth and deliver'd much after the ſame manner as <hi>Naturall waters</hi> uſe to be out of <hi>wells;</hi> for theſe at the firſt draught are either receiv'd into <hi>Ciſternes,</hi> and ſo may be convayed and diriv'd by many Pipes for publique and private uſe; or is powred forth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly in Buckets and veſſells, to be us'd out of hand, as occaſion requires.</p>
               <p>§ Now this former <hi>Methodicall manner</hi> hath at length brought forth unto us <hi>Scholaſticall Theologie,</hi> whereby <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> hath bin collected into an <hi>Art,</hi> as into a <hi>Ciſterne;</hi> and the ſtreames of <hi>Axioms</hi> and <hi>Poſitions,</hi> diſtributed from thence into all parts.</p>
               <p>§ But in <hi>ſolute Manner of Interpreting, two extreams</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene; the one <hi>preſuppoſeth ſuch a perfection in Scriptures, as that all Philoſophie ought to be fetcht and diriv'd from thoſe ſacred fountains; as if all other Philoſophy were an unhallowed and Heatheniſh thing.</hi> This diſtemperature hath prevaild eſpecially in the Schoole of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> and ſome others; the ſource and ſpring whereof flowed from the Rabbins and Cabaliſts. But theſe men have not attain'd their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; nor doe they give honour (as they pretend) to <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> but rather embaſe and diſtaine them. For to ſeeke a <hi>materiate Heaven,</hi> and Earth in the word of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is ſaid <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. XXIV.</note> 
                  <hi>but my word ſhall not paſſe,</hi> is indeed to purſue Temporarie things amongſt eternall: <hi>for as to ſeek Divinity in Philoſophy, is as if you would ſeek the living amongſt the Dead;</hi> ſo on the other ſide <hi>to ſeek Philoſophy in Divinity, is all one as to ſeek the Dead amongſt the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ The other <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Jnterpreting,</hi> which we ſet downe as an exceſſe, ſeems at firſt ſight ſober and chaſt; yet notwithſtanding it both diſhonoureth <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and is a great prejudice and detriment to the Church; and it is, to ſpeak in a word, when <hi>Divinely inſpir'd Scriptures are
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:150781:300"/> expounded after the ſame manner that humane writings are:</hi> For it muſt be remembred, that there are two points known to God the Author of Scripture, which mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot comprehend; that is, <hi>The ſecrets of the Heart; and the ſucceſsion of times.</hi> Wherefore ſeeing the Precepts and Dictates of Scriptures were written and <hi>directed to the Heart and Thoughts of men,</hi> and comprehend the viciſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of all Ages, with an eternall and certain fore-ſight of all Hereſies, <hi>Contradictions,</hi> differing and mutable eſtates of the Church, as well in generall, as of the Elect in ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; they are to be interpreted according to the Latitude and the proper ſenſe of the place, and reſpectively toward that preſent occaſion whereupon the words were utter'd; or in preciſe congruity from the Context of the precedent and ſubſequent words; or in contemplation of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſcope of the place; but ſo as we conceive them to comprehend, not only totally or collectively, but diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butively, even in clauſes and in every word, infinite ſprings and ſtreams of Doctrine to water every part of the Church and the ſpirits of the Faithfull. For it hath bin excellently obſerved that the Anſwers of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> to many of the queſtions which were propounded to him, ſeem not to the purpoſe, but as it were, impertinent to the ſtate of the queſtion demanded. The Reaſons hereof are two: the one, that being he knew the <hi>thoughts</hi> of thoſe that propounded the Queſtions, not from their words, as we men uſe to doe, but immediatly and of himſelfe, he made anſwer to their <hi>thoughts</hi> not to their <hi>words.</hi> The other Reaſon is, that he ſpak not only to them that were then preſent, but to us alſo who now live, and to men of every Age and place to whom the Goſpell ſhould be preacht: which ſenſe in many places of Scripture muſt take place.</p>
               <p>§ Theſe thus briefely toucht and fore-taſted, come we now to that Treatiſe which we report as <hi>Deficient.</hi> There are found indeed amongſt <hi>Theologicall writings</hi> too many <hi>books of Controverſies,</hi> an infinite maſſe of that <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> which we call <hi>Poſitive,</hi> as <hi>Common-places; Particular
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:150781:301"/> Treatiſes; Caſes of Conſcience; Sermons; Homilies,</hi> and many <hi>Prolix Commentaries</hi> upon the <hi>Books of Scripture:</hi> but the Forme of writing <hi>Deficient</hi> is this, namely <hi>a ſuccinct and ſound Collection, and that with judgement, of Annotations and obſervations upon particular Texts of Scripture; not dilateing into common-places; or chaſeing after Controverſies; or reduceing them into method of Art: but which be altogither ſcatterd and Naturall;</hi> a thing indeed now and then expreſt in more learned Sermons, which for moſt part vaniſh; but which as yet, is not collected into Books that ſhould be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Certainly</hi> as wines which at firſt preſsing run gently, yeeld a more pleaſant taſt, than thoſe where the wine-preſſe is hard wrought; becauſe thoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what reliſh of the ſtone and skinne of the Grape; ſo thoſe obſervations are moſt wholſome and ſweet, which flow from Scriptures gently expreſt, and naturally expounded, and are not wreſted or drawn aſide to common-places or Controverſies; ſuch a Treatiſe we will name <hi>The Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>§ Thus have we made as it were, a <hi>ſmall Globe of the Jntellectuall world,</hi> as faithfully as we could, togither with a deſignation and deſcription of thoſe parts which I find not conſtantly occupate, or not well converted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and labours of men. In which work if I have any where receded from the opinion of the Ancients, I deſire that Poſterity would ſo judge of my intentions, as that this was done with a mind of further <hi>Progreſsion,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience in melius;</hi> and not out of a humour of <hi>Jnnovation,</hi> or Tranſmigration <hi>in aliud:</hi> for I could not be true and conſtant to my ſelfe, or the Argument which I have in hand, if I had not reſolvedly determin'd, <hi>To adde to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of others,</hi> ſo farre as I was able. And I am as willing, and as ſyncerely wiſh that later ages may goe beyond me hereafter, as I have endeavourd to goe beyond others now. And how faithfully I have dealt in this Buſineſſe may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this, that I have propounded my opinions eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where naked &amp; unarm'd, not ſeeking to prejudicate the
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:150781:301"/> Liberty of others by the pugnacity of confutations. For in any thing which I have well ſet downe, I am in good hope that it will come ſo to paſſe, that if in the firſt reading a ſcruple or objection be mov'd, in the ſecond reading an anſwer will be ready made; and in thoſe things wherein I have chanc't to erre, I am ſure I have not prejudiced the right by litigious arguments, which commonly are of this nature, <hi>that they procure Authority to error, and derogate from Good inventions; for from Dubitation Error acquires Honour, Truth ſuffers repulſe.</hi> And now I call to mind an Anſwer <hi>Themistocles</hi> made, who, when an Ambaſſador in a ſet ſpeech had boaſted great matters of a ſmall Village, takes him up thus, <hi>Friend your words would require a Citty.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Plut. in vita.</note> Surely I ſuppoſe it may be juſtly objected to me, that <hi>my words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an Age,</hi> a whole Age perchance to prove them, and many Ages to perfect them. Notwithſtanding ſeeing the greateſt matters are owing unto their Principles, it is enough to me that I have <hi>Sowen unto Poſterity and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall God,</hi> whoſe divine Majeſty I humbly implore through his ſonne and our Saviour, that he would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe gratiouſly to accept theſe and ſuch <hi>like ſacrifices of Humane underſtanding ſeaſond with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as with ſalt, and incenſed to his Glory.</hi>
